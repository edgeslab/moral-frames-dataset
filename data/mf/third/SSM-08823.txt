Gay marriage case decisons could come Friday from U.S. Supreme Court
The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday is again scheduled to meet behind closed doors to consider whether to review the legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage, including the challenge to California's Proposition 8.
Here are some of the possible outcomes that could be revealed by early afternoon:
The court could refuse to review a lower-court ruling striking down Proposition 8, which would legalize same-sex marriage in California.
Gay and lesbian couples could wed as soon as sometime next week.
The court could decide to review the Proposition 8 case, and would rule by the end of the term in June.
The court could put the Proposition 8 on hold while reviewing one of several challenges to the federal Defense of Marriage Act also on the docket.
That would put off a final decision on California's law indefinitely, and preserve for now the status quo on same-sex marriages in the state.
The court may also not release orders until Monday, typical for its weekly conferences, or continue to consider how to proceed on all the same-sex marriage cases at another conference when they return in January.
