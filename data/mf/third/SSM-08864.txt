Will Md.
vote boost wedding business?
Immediately after same-sex marriage was approved by popular vote in Maryland on Tuesday night, the Rev.
Bonnie Berger's Facebook page began buzzing with inquiries.
"Is our marriage legal now?"
one couple wanted to know.
Another couple who had officially wed in Washington, D.C. - where same-sex marriage has been legal for more than two years - wanted to renew their vows in Maryland, their home state.
Berger, a Takoma Park, Md.-based interfaith minister who specializes in same-sex ceremonies, received about a dozen inquiries Tuesday night.
Tuesday's decision added Maryland and Maine to a handful of states where same-sex marriages are legal - the others are Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont - but the two were the first to approve same-sex marriage by popular vote.
For some, the decision is more than just a gay-rights milestone.
It could also have an economic impact, potentially increasing the market for wedding-related services, a big-ticket item in many a couple's life.
Berger officiates about 100 wedding ceremonies a year, about three-quarters of which are for same-sex couples.
Those who want an official legal ceremony have been forced to trek to the District, and they often follow it up with a reception closer to their residences in Maryland, she said.
But about half the same-sex couples she knows in Maryland have opted to wait until their marriage is legalized in their home state to get married, Berger said, because they don't want to feel like they have to "cross the border to get married."
