E-cigarettes blow fog into Metro's smoking ban
Smoking's not allowed on the Metro.
But what about e-smoking?
Tuesday, I was headed toward Court House on the Orange Line when I saw a woman holding what I thought was a high-end felt-tip marker.
It had a round barrel that tapered to a narrower point.
Then she stuck the narrow end in her mouth, sucked, and blew out a white cloud.
It didn't smell like cigarette smoke, at least from where I was sitting.
It seemed like more of a vapor.
And, indeed, that's what it was.
The modern nicotine-delivery device - the electronic cigarette - doesn't produce smoke.
Nicotine-infused liquid is heated, creating a vapor that the user inhales and then exhales.
In the blessedly cigarette-free Metro, it was jarring to see the woman "vape."
(That's the term the e-cig community has adopted for what they do.)
People are still figuring out how to treat the devices.
The Department of Transportation said it was going to ban them on airline flights and then decided to defer to individual airlines.
In Hawaii, the buses of the Oahu Transit Services implemented a ban May 1.
But what about on Metro?
Things are as hazy as a cloud of smoke from an unfiltered Camel.
"What most people don't realize is that it is actually local ordinances that govern what's prohibited on Metro," Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said.
