Amendment to highway bill sideswipes Little Tobacco
Nobody mentioned tobacco last week when the Senate adopted an amendment to the $109 billion http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c112:2:./temp/~c112t6K8Vc::-URL-federal highway bill.
But tucked into the 5,600-word http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r112:1:./temp/~r112ajs4I2:e0:-URL-amendmen t to provide aid for rural schools was a single paragraph that would settle a two-year-old fight between Big Tobacco and a small Ohio company that builds a do-it-yourself machine that allows smokers to get their cigarettes a lot cheaper.
The amendment would reclassify tobacco shops that offer the machines as "tobacco manufacturers," imposing on them new regulations and higher taxes.
It also opens a window into the ways of Washington, where the powerful and the connected can sometimes win even before the opposition knows the game is underway.
"This is catastrophic," was the response to the Senate's action by  Phil Accordino, whose tiny company builds the roll-your-own cigarette machines in Girard, Ohio, when he heard of the Senate action.
Word arrived in Ohio after the amendment had already been approved on a bipartisan vote.
Officials with the tobacco companies, and allies who include some public health advocates, counter that they've been trying to crack down on ultra cheap and unregulated cigarettes, which they contend skirt tax and health laws.
http://www.baucus.senate.gov/-URL-Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.
), who sponsored the Secure Rural Schools amendment, said that the $346 million program supports schools and road projects in Montana and elsewhere.
He said the $97 million tobacco provision helps provide "critical funding" for the program by closing a loophole that some smokers have been using to avoid taxes.
