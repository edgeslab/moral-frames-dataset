Bar owners weigh in on need for smoking ban exemptions Drinking establishments don't want to lose business to competitors that allow customers to take a puff.
CLAYTON o Bar owners talked about freedom, fairness and personal responsibility as they spoke out Wednesday about a proposal before the St. Louis County Council to eliminate almost all exemptions to the countywide smoking ban.
Most who spoke hold such exemptions; a few others do not.
Both sides argued that the matter boiled down to economics.
"If you remove the exemptions, you're going to put people out of business," said Jim Schmitt, who owns Schmitt's Bar & Grill in Overland.
Tim Tucker, whose Locker Room bar in Florissant does not have an exemption, said, "Exemptions have hurt my business.
It's not fair that one bar can do something that my bar cannot."
The owners attended the meeting at the invitation of County Councilman Mike O'Mara, D-Florissant, who introduced a bill last month to remove the exemptions.
Establishments are eligible for exemptions if food sales total less than 25 percent of the annual total sales of food and beverage.
The ordinance also exempted gambling floors at casinos.
After the meeting, O'Mara said that some owners had made an impression on him.
"I am concerned for these little bar owners.
I wonder if there isn't an option for them (to keep exemptions) based on square footage, no food (served) or if they only let in people over 21."
O'Mara said he wanted to create a level playing field for all business owners.
