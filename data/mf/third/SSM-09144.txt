Justices give gay-marriage cases a look; 'Watershed year' for movement could continue
The Supreme Court wades into a wide array of same-sex marriage cases today, and its actions could put the crowning touch on a year of major progress for the gay rights movement.
The nine justices must decide which case or cases to consider from among seven on their plate, from the right to marry in California to the receipt of federal marriage benefits from coast to coast.
Though oral arguments and court rulings would be months away, just the choices made in today's closed-door conference could doom California's troubled Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage or put the federal Defense of Marriage Act on the defensive.
The court is virtually certain to take up at least one of the cases involving the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage in federal statutes as between a man and a woman.
Lower courts from California to New England have struck down a key section of the law, inviting a Supreme Court decision.
The impact of that section has been to deny federal assistance, such as tax exclusions and Social Security survivor benefits, to gay and lesbian couples.
Less certain is whether the justices will consider California's Proposition 8, approved by voters in 2008 but since declared unconstitutional by two federal courts.
If they don't, gays and lesbians in the nation's largest state will be able to marry again, as 18,000 couples did before the referendum was passed.
