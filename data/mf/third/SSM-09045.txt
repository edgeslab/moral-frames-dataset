Fought in courts in '80s for same-sex marriage
Richard Adams made history when he and his partner of four years, Anthony Sullivan, became one of the first gay couples in the country to be granted a marriage license.
It happened in Boulder, Colo., where a county clerk issued licenses to six same-sex couples in the spring of 1975.
Mr. Adams hoped to use his marriage to secure permanent residency in the United States for Sullivan, an Australian who had been in the country on a limited visa and was facing deportation.
But Colorado's attorney general declared the Boulder marriages invalid.
Several months later, Mr. Adams and Sullivan received a letter from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service that denied Sullivan's petition for resident status in terms that left no doubt about the reason:
"You have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots," the notification read.
Mr. Adams, who later filed the first federal lawsuit demanding recognition of same-sex marriages, died Dec. 17 at his home in Hollywood, Calif., said his attorney, Lavi Soloway.
He was 65.
The cause of death was not disclosed.
Soloway described Mr. Adams and Sullivan as "pioneers who stood up and fought for something nobody at that time conceived of as a right: the right of gay couples to be married."
"Attitudes at the time were not supportive, to put it mildly," Soloway said.
"They went on the [Phil] Donahue show, and people in the audience said some pretty nasty things.
But they withstood it all because they felt it was important to speak out."
