BEST TEXT EVER Immigs await ping making them legal
IT'S THE TEXT message that could change their lives.
Tens of thousands of young immigrants who came here illegally as children are waiting to hear from the feds after applying for work permits and deportation reprieves under a new program.
More than 82,000 have applied for the "deferred action" program, the U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Service said.
Only 29 have been approved so far.
The first to come forward is Carlos Martinez, 30, who was notified last week that he can stay and work in the U.S. for two years.
"I felt like crying," Martinez, who has two engineering degrees but couldn't work because he's undocumented, told the Arizona Republic.
Many others are anxiously awaiting a text message telling them about action on their case.
Officials said the initial approvals happened sooner than they expected, adding that full reviews could take up to six months.
John, a College of Staten Island student who left Nigeria for Brooklyn when he was 2, sent in his $465 application Aug. 20.
On Tuesday, he had fingerprints taken at a service center; he's one of 60,000 who have appointments for that step in the application process.
Next comes a background check and final review.
"I'm happy, but I don't want to get my hopes up too high yet," said the graphic design student, who did not want his last name used.
The new program does not provide a green card or a path to citizenship.
But John can use a work permit to get a Social Security card and then apply for a driver's license.
