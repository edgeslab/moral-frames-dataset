Voters in four states to consider same-sex marriage measures
Maine voters on Tuesday could make their state the first in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage without prior legislative action.
In Minnesota, meanwhile, residents will vote on a measure that would ban gay marriage, while allowing civil unions.
Overall, residents in four states on Election Day will decide closely watched questions related to gay rights.
In Maryland and Washington state, voters will decide whether to uphold or reverse moves to permit same-sex marriage.
In the United States, six states have legalized gay marriage: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Iowa, New York, New Hampshire and Vermont; the District of Columbia and two Native American tribal jurisdictions have followed suit.
All have done so by legislation or court order.
Since 1998, 31 states have had gay marriage questions on their ballots, and voters have rejected them every time.
But this year could be different.
A Washington Post poll shows that 52 percent of Maryland voters are in favor of question 6; a "yes" vote would uphold Democratic Gov.
Martin O'Malley's move to legalize gay marriage.
The poll shows 43 percent likely to vote against it.
Polls in Washington state show similar results, with a KCTS-9 survey showing 57.3 percent likely voting to keep the law in place, compared to 36.2 percent of voters who said they are against it.
The poll also asked voters what general issues are most important to them ahead of the election, and 21.3 percent answered that gay rights/marriage equality mattered most to them.
