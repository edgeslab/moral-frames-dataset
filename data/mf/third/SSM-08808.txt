Bay Area same-sex marriage supporters optimistic about court taking on Prop.
8 case
SAN FRANCISCO -- Reaction was cautiously optimistic on Friday from supporters of same-sex marriage to news the U.S. Supreme Court would review a challenge to California's Proposition 8 and another case involving the federal government's ban on benefits for same-sex couples.
"It's a bittersweet moment," said 35-year-old Renata Moirera, who lives in San Francisco with her partner Lori Bilella, 29.
"But we are optimistic that by next year the Supreme Court will stand on the right side of history and declare once and for all that all loving families deserve to be granted the right to marriage.
We are also optimistic as we see our family, friends and neighbors coming out and supporting our unions and realizing there families are similar to ours."
Moirera said she and Bilella plan to marry in New York in September, on their fifth-year anniversary.
"But at the same time we want to be able to get married in our home state," she said Friday.
In orders issued Friday afternoon, Supreme Court justices decided to review a federal appeals court's ruling earlier this year striking down Proposition 8, California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage.
As a result, the court would rule on the case by the end of its term in June.
In the meantime, same-sex marriage remains on hold in California.
The court is expected to hear arguments in the case in mid to late March.
