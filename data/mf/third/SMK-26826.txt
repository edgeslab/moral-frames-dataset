Lighting up?
Don't make public suffer
Regarding the article "Smoking bans beach-bound?
", if the smoking public wants to imperil their health in public spaces, by all means let them.
But they must grasp the simple concept that our most treasured natural resource, our greatest economic draw -- a source of their job?
-- our beaches are not their personal ashtray.
What's not to understand about that?
Who thinks it's acceptable to enjoy a day at the beach while stubbing cigarettes out in the sand?
Only folks who feel a sense of entitlement.
It's the same as cleaning up after your dog when out walking.
Take responsibility.
Of course you are entitled to smoke, but not to litter sidewalks, green areas and beaches with your butts.
Ruin your own health.
Increase your own health insurance premiums.
Risk heart disease.
But don't make the rest of us suffer along with you.

More important issues abound
No less than the front page dedicated to a "California-styled, there is nothing left to legislate but cigarette butts on the beach" initiative.
Florida cannot get the primaries right.
Florida cannot get an election count process right.
Consider more reporting on relevant legislation to push back on mobile phone use and texting in automobiles.
California and umpteen more states have already addressed the issue, but it seems the cellphone operators are the same guys as the Big Sugar dudes.
