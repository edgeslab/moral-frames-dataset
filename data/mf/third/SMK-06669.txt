Disease with a smoking gun Tobacco is the main cause of lung tumors, the most deadly form of cancer in the U.S.
Who's at risk
One of the most common cancers in this country, lung cancer will affect one in 13 men and one in 16 women in the course of a lifetime.
"Lung cancer is the abnormal uncontrolled growth of cells in the lung, which then start invading other tissues," says Dr. Juan Wisnivesky of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
"About 90% of lung cancers are related to smoking, though the number of nonsmokers affected is on the rise."
Lung cancer is the main cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States.
Men and women of all ethnic backgrounds are at risk of developing lung cancer if they are exposed to cigarette smoke.
"The primary cause of lung cancer is smoking, though there is probably also a genetic component," says Wisnivesky.
"Chronic exposure to smoking produces irritation of the lungs' lining and changes how the cells grow.
Eventually the cells can lose the checks that normally protect against uncontrolled growth."
In rare cases, lung cancer is caused by occupational exposure or radon that accumulates in some basements.
Lung damage accumulates over time, so lung cancer tends to develop in middle-age or older patients.
"Sixty-nine to 70 years of age is the average age of diagnosis," says Wisnivesky.
"It probably takes at least 10 years to develop, which is why some people stop smoking and then develop lung cancer 30 years later."
