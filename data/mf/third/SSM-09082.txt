Delay Sought For Visa Cases That Involve Same-Sex Spouses
In a letter to the White House on Monday, more than 50 gay rights and immigrant advocacy groups asked President Obama to delay immigration cases involving Americans who are seeking legal residency visas, known as green cards, for their foreign-born spouses of the same sex until the Supreme Court issues a ruling on same-sex marriage next year.
Under the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a same-sex marriage cannot be a valid basis for federal benefits, including immigration documents.
Administration officials have been denying applications for green cards for foreign-born same-sex spouses of American citizens.
On Friday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases involving same-sex marriages, including a direct challenge to the federal law.
The groups are asking the administration to postpone decisions on green card applications from gay couples until the court rules.
