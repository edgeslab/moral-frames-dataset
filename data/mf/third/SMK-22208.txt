Philadelphia-area hospitals acting to curb smoking
When Albert Einstein Healthcare Network's Elkins Park campus goes tobacco-free Thursday, it will join the majority of hospitals around the region, including all in South Jersey, that in the last few years have banned tobacco from their entire campuses, including parking lots and sidewalks.
Even some of those that allow some smoking somewhere - though rarely inside - are taking leadership roles on an issue that is often described as a moral imperative for institutions whose mission is health.
Abington Memorial Hospital and its various campuses stopped hiring smokers July 1.
Roxborough Memorial Hospital this year added a surcharge for employees who receive health benefits if they or their spouses smoke.
"Hospitals want to get in front on this as a health issue," said Bronson Frick, associate director of the Berkeley, Calif., advocacy group Americans for Non-smokers' Rights.
They also are trying to hold down the costs of insuring workers, who sometimes smoke at higher rates than people in other professions, perhaps because of stress.
A 2008 national survey by the Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals but does not evaluate campus smoking policies, estimated that 45 percent had banned smoking from every inch of their grounds and predicted that the figure would increase to 60 percent within a year.
An Inquirer survey of hospitals in the region found a similar percentage banning tobacco of all kinds.
