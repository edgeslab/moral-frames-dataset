NBC tells Chelsea to zip it
NBC WANTS Chelsea Clinton to keep quiet when it comes to marriage equality.
The network quashed videos Clinton shot in support of a Washington State referendum on gay marriage, BuzzFeed reported.
Clinton, who works as a "special correspondent" for NBC News, likely was prohibited from the advocacy to avoid allegations of bias.
The videos were to be posted on TheFour.com, a site dedicated to marriage-equality issues that were on the ballot in four states on Nov. 6.
In the ads, Clinton says everyone should have the right to marry, a source told the website.
But in the end, the movement did fine without Clinton's public support - gay marriage got the green light from voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington.
And in Minnesota, a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between a man and a woman failed.
In 2011 - prior to her job as a reporter - Clinton spoke in support of marriage equality in New York.
BuzzFeed reported that Clinton's gig at NBC News, as well as her earlier advocacy for gay marriage, are indicators that the former first daughter is considering a foray into political life.
