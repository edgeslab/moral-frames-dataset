States' Votes for Gay Marriage Are Timely, With Justices Ready to Weigh Cases
WASHINGTON -- The victories for same-sex marriage on Tuesday, the first ones achieved at the ballot box rather than through courts or legislatures, are evidence of a remarkable shift in public opinion.
They are also exceptionally timely data points for the Supreme Court.
At their private conference scheduled for Nov. 20, the justices plan to consider some 10 requests that they address various aspects of what the Constitution has to say about same-sex marriage.
It is close to certain that the court will agree to hear at least one case on the subject, with a decision expected by June.
The justices tend to say they are not influenced by public opinion.
But they do sometimes take account of state-by-state trends, and the latest developments will not escape their notice.
On Tuesday, Maine and Maryland became the first states to embrace same-sex marriage through direct democracy, and Washington State seems poised to follow once all of the votes there are counted.
Voters in Minnesota, which continues to bar same-sex marriage, rejected an attempt to withdraw the subject from democratic debate and judicial scrutiny through a state constitutional amendment.
''I would guess that 50 years from now, the high school civics books will treat Nov. 6, 2012, as a red-letter day in the history of the gay rights movement,'' said Michael J. Klarman, a law professor and historian at Harvard.
Assuming Washington follows Maine and Maryland, he added, ''The number of states with gay marriage increased by 50 percent overnight.''
