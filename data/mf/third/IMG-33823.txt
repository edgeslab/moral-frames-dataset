"I came here when I was around 7 or 8 years old from Toluca, Mexico.
My father had previously come two years before and we stayed back home -- with my mom and my sister.
I was going to school and all of a sudden my mom said, 'We've got to go.'
I didn't even get to say goodbye to anyone.
We took a plane to Tijuana, along with my uncle.
He was going with us.
I was confused about what was going on.
We stayed at a home of a person who was going to cross us over the border.
I hadn't seen my father for like two years.
When he left, I was like 5 years old.
It was like a blurry memory.
My sister and I crossed in a car with two men and (the border patrol) didn't ask for documents.
We got to San Diego and we stayed at a home where my father's boss used to live.
The following day, we took a train to Orange County and I got picked up by my dad and another guy.
When my dad showed up, I was like, 'Who is that guy?'
He had a mustache.
He was wearing stunners (sunglasses).
