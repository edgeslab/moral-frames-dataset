The six Baltimore police offers who were charged this month in the death of Freddie Gray asked a Maryland judge on Wednesday to move their trial from the city, where suspicions of police misconduct provoked both violent unrest and days of peaceful demonstrations.
The 85-page motion chronicled the widespread anger in Baltimore after Gray’s death, as well as the effects of the strategies to restore order.
The demonstrations and the government’s response to them, lawyers for the officers wrote, would make it all but impossible to select an impartial jury.
“Every citizen of Baltimore was impacted by the events surrounding the arrest and death of Freddie Gray,” the motion said, “And every potential juror would bring their passions and prejudices relating to the events with them to the courtroom.”
