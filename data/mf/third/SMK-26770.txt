Using Former Smokers to Spur Others to Quit
In the last year, Terrie Hall, a former smoker from North Carolina, has become something of a national celebrity.
A year ago she was featured in a series of nationwide advertisements that showed the grim consequences of smoking.
In one widely seen television ad, Ms. Hall, who is 52 and has head and neck cancer, takes viewers through her morning routine: inserting a set of false teeth and fitting a small speaker inside a hole in her neck.
Since the graphic ads began airing, Ms. Hall has been stopped regularly on the street.
"Strangers come up to me and tell me they quit smoking because they saw my ad," she said.
"One woman in South Carolina broke down in tears and gave me a hug in the middle of a Walgreens.
"I hugged her hard," she added.
"It's a good feeling to know that you've helped somebody."
The commercials last year marked the first time that the federal government directly attacked the tobacco industry in paid, national advertisements.
The campaign, called "Tips From Former Smokers," lasted just 12 weeks.
But federal health officials say it was so successful that they are launching a second round, featuring new ads, starting on Monday.
This time the ads will include nonsmokers debilitated by secondhand smoke, as well as vulnerable groups like diabetics and American Indians.
About a third of all American Indians and Alaska Natives smoke, the highest of any ethnic group in this country.
