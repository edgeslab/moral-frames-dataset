The Military's Swift Path to Citizenship
The Pentagon has just restarted a program to enlist skilled immigrants into the Army, giving recruits a swift path to citizenship in return for their special abilities in languages and medicine.
The program was suspended nearly three years ago as part of a broad security review prompted by the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Tex.
To have squelched a good idea so quickly and for so long was surely an overreaction (the man charged in the Fort Hood killings is a native-born American).
But now that it's back, we hope that the Army swiftly makes up for lost time with new classes of high-caliber recruits, and that the other service branches ramp up their own participation.
The program will accept 1,500 people a year for the next two years -- good for the Army, but only a sliver of America's untapped supply of immigrant talent and patriotic yearning.
We hope, too, that those who recognize the Army's success concede the bigger point.
The happy confluence of opportunity and skills is not a phenomenon peculiar to the Defense Department but is the essence of America's immigrant history, whether the newcomer is an Army surgeon or translator or an Oregon entrepreneur or a Long Island landscaper.
America's economy and society benefit mightily when immigration works, but the system today is a mess of bottlenecks and frustrations, stymied by political paralysis and a sour, restrictionist mood.
