DFL balks at putting gay marriage on front burner
A Democratic state senator said he'll introduce a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in Minnesota next year when his party assumes control of the Legislature, but the state's DFL governor and top legislative leaders say they're in no hurry to pursue the issue.
A day after Minnesota voters rejected an attempt to write man-woman marriage into the state constitution, observers and others were left to gauge how much of a push it will lead to for legalizing gay marriage.
The new party caucuses in the House and Senate "are going to need a chance to talk among themselves, and we're going to need a chance to talk with them before we formulate what our policies will be or won't be," Gov.
Mark Dayton said Wednesday, Nov. 7, at a news conference with DFL leaders.
Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, has introduced legislation to authorize same-sex marriage in the past and said he will do so again.
"I do intend to continue pushing for marriage equality, and I'd like to have it happen now," he said Wednesday.
"I want to take care of that as soon as we can.
We've waited far too long already."
Marty said his plan would not force any church to perform same-sex marriages.
"We're going to do it not by bashing somebody else; we're going to do it by saying we respect their rights, too," he said.
