Mi Pueblo markets came under U.S. immigration audit, company says
Federal immigration agents launched an audit of the 21-store Mi Pueblo supermarket chain in mid-August after hearing complaints about suspected illegal immigrant workers, the company announced Friday.
The audit of I-9 forms, known as a "silent raid," was the reason the San Jose-based grocer voluntarily joined the federal E-Verify system a short time later to check the immigration status of all new hires.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has audited more than 6,500 worksites nationwide since 2009, but "most companies choose not to talk about it because it is confidential," said company lawyer Julie Case.
She led a press conference Friday to dispel rumors she said were spreading fear and division.
The announcement comes days before a threatened boycott is to begin at noon Monday, led by a union trying to organize Mi Pueblo's more than 3,000 workers and demanding that the company stop using E-Verify.
The union said Friday it is backing off on the E-Verify demand amid news of the ICE audit, but is proceeding with the boycott because Mi Pueblo refuses to sign a labor agreement.
Supermarket workers are even more upset about how this was handled than they were before, said Gerardo Dominguez, campaign coordinator for the Justice for Mercado Workers Coalition.
It is seeking to unionize thousands of Latino and Asian grocery workers around the state.
"People are very anxious, very nervous, very upset," said Dominguez.
He said one worker recently quit because he was feeling too much stress.
