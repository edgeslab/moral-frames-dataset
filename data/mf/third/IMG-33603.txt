Post-election, new momentum for a path to citizenship
A growing number of conservatives are softening their views on immigration in the wake of President Obama's dominating performance among Hispanic voters, giving new momentum to a years-long push by advocates to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants.
Yet even as officials in both parties pledged to make overhauling immigration a top goal in the coming months, it became clear Friday that the issue remains thorny for each side.
House Speaker John A. Boehner was criticized by some in his party for a Thursday interview in which he endorsed passing a "comprehensive" plan, adopting the language of immigrant advocates pushing for citizenship.
By the time Boehner faced reporters for a Friday news conference, his remarks were more tepid, focusing primarily on the border-security theme that is more comfortable terrain for Republicans.
"I'm not talking about a 3,000-page bill," he said.
"What I'm talking about is a common sense, step-by-step approach [that] would secure our borders, allow us to enforce the laws and fix a broken immigration system."
Pressed on whether he would ever support giving illegal immigrants the chance to be citizens, the speaker demurred: "I'm not going to get into any of the details of how you would get there.
It's just time to get the job done."
The issue promises to also be complicated for Obama and his fellow Democrats, who will face unprecedented pressure from a newly empowered political base to secure a complete victory, citizenship path and all.
