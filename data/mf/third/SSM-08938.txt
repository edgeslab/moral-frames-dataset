The Black Vote for Gay Marriage
I began conceiving of this documentary on election night in 2008.
I was in California, where marriage equality was on the ballot in the form of Proposition 8.
As the night progressed, it became clear that same-sex couples in California would lose their recently won right to marry.
The elation that many felt about President Obama's election was countered by spontaneous protests and visible outrage at this inequity.
Almost immediately, it was wrongly reported that the African-American community had voted for Proposition 8 by 70 percent.
Many of us watched in horror as latent resentments, outright racism and homophobia bubbled to the top of the national political scene.
It was then that I decided to make a documentary to explore the complicated relationship between the African-American and gay civil rights movements.
I have been shooting ''The New Black,'' the film from which this Op-Doc video is adapted, for the past three years.
In the course of production, I realized that the issue of gay rights in the black community is in many ways a fight over the African-American family, which has been a contested space since the time of slavery.
So marriage is not just about marriage for black people -- it's also about how blacks have become accepted as legitimate participants in American society.
Now this issue is playing out in Maryland.
In February, the State Legislature passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
And just as with Proposition 8 in California, opponents to this bill collected enough signatures to put it on the ballot next week.
