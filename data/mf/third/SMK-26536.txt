COULD BIG TOBACCO GO UP IN SMOKE?
I have next to zero sympathy for John Rizzuto.
Yes, it's a shame he's too sick to play ball with his grandkids or walk his dog.
But that sort of thing tends to happen when you spend four decades smoking high-tar cigarettes such as L&Ms and Marlboros.
Rizzuto - a retired U.S. postal worker from Spring Hill - started lighting up 53 years ago, which was three years after the U.S. surgeon general first stated that "excessive" smoking causes cancer.
Like 50 million other people in this country, he eventually kicked the habit.
But then he sued the tobacco companies - and last week received a jury award of $12.5 million - claiming cigarettes are so addictive that quitting is all but impossible.
Yes, it's hard to imagine a less sympathetic party, until you look across the courtroom at the representatives of the tobacco industry.
"It's an enterprise of death.
They kill people for money, bottom line," said Scott Schlesinger.
Schlesinger is a Fort Lauderdale lawyer who specializes in fighting tobacco companies.
He would say that.
But juries all over Florida are realizing it's not far from the truth, shifting some of the legal blame from the weak wills of smokers such as Rizzuto to cigarette makers.
If this trend spreads across the country, which is starting to happen, Schlesinger said, it could help sink tobacco sales in the United States.
