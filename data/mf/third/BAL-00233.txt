Baltimore prosecutors have asked a judge to impose an order preventing lawyers in the Freddie Gray case from talking about it, saying lawyers for six police officers are trying to influence people who might be on a grand jury or serve on a trial jury.
Mr. Gray died on April 19, a week after he was fatally injured during his arrest by the police.
Prosecutors cited concerns about statements that defense lawyers made at a news conference last week on behalf of one of the officers, Sgt.
Alicia White, as possibly having a ''prejudicial effect'' on the case.
