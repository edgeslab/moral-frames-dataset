Palo Alto City Council bans smoking in all parks
Big or small, all of Palo Alto's public parks will soon be smoke-free.
The city council voted 7-1 late Monday night to ban smoking in the city's 38 parks and open spaces.
Council Member Pat Burt cast the dissenting vote and Council Member Karen Holman was absent.
"I think it would be fabulous to have Palo Alto as a smoke-free park city," said Council Member Liz Kniss.
"We could put it on our letterhead.
Maybe we should just rule out smoking in the entire city."
Council members were initially scheduled to consider an ordinance that would only outlaw smoking in parks that are less than five acres.
But it was widened at the suggestion of Mayor Greg Scharff.
"It's a great headline: Palo Alto bans smoking in all ... 4,500 acres of our parkland," Kniss said.
A wider ban will be easier to enforce than one that is more selective, said City Manager James Keene.
The ordinance is expected to be in place by mid-July.
Burt said he supported the concept but favored sending it first to the city's Parks and Recreation Commission for vetting.
"I think we ought to just follow the process," Burt said.
"I don't want to presume I thought of everything."
The city's move to ban smoking in parks received a thumbs-up from Janet Ghanem, a program coordinator with Breathe California of the Bay Area.
