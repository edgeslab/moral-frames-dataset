Prince has announced that he will headline a “Rally 4 Peace” concert at Royal Farms Arena in Baltimore on Sunday.
Prince & Third Eye Girl will be joined by several as yet unannounced special guests.
The announcement came days after debuting “Baltimore,” a tribute to Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old who suffered a fatal spinal-cord injury while in police custody.
“In a spirit of healing, the event is meant to be a catalyst for pause and reflection following the outpouring of violence that has gripped Baltimore and areas throughout the U.S.,” the press release reads.
“As a symbolic message of our shared humanity and love for one another, attendees are invited to wear something gray in tribute to all those recently lost in the violence.”
Proceeds from the event will go to benefit several Baltimorea-area youth-based charities.
