Immigrant detention numbers hold up
The American Civil Liberties Union estimates the federal government spends $1.7 billion a year to detain illegal immigrants, which the group thinks is a waste of money.
The ACLU Foundation of Georgia recently sent out a news release that decried the spending, made complaints about inadequate staffing levels and claimed some detainees are being mistreated at federal facilities, including the Stewart Detention Center in southwest Georgia.
There was one set of numbers included in the release about detainees nationally that PolitiFact Georgia wanted to fact-check.
"In the last 15 years, we've witnessed a dramatic expansion in the jailing of immigrants, from about 70,000 people detained annually to about 400,000," the release said.
The liberal-leaning foundation has used these estimates in other news releases.
We wondered whether the claim was correct, or is the ACLU using inflated numbers to bolster its argument?
Azadeh N. Shahshahani, director of the foundation's National Security/Immigrants' Rights Project, said it based the claim off reports it has seen.
We found lots of information detailing the current number of detainees.
The data for detainees held 15 years ago?
Not so easy to find.
In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.
Under the law, any person entering the United States illegally will be barred from entering the country legally for five years.
A person who enters the United States illegally again and is caught will be banned from entering legally for 20 years.
Federal reports we reviewed show there's been an increase in the number of illegal immigrants detained since the law was passed.
