BROAD TOBACCO BAN REJECTED
Faced with a proposal to ban tobacco from all school district property, the School Board opted to butt out.
The comprehensive tobacco-free policy, advocated by the state Department of Health, would forbid smoking and other forms of tobacco use on all district property, including athletic fields and parking lots.
That would have meant snuffing out all tobacco use not just on school campuses but also on other property where students rarely or never go, such as the maintenance office and the district administration headquarters in Brooksville.
That's going too far, a majority of board members agreed during a workshop Tuesday.
"At the end of the day, is smoking a smart choice?
No, it's not," member Matt Foreman said.
"But do you have the ability, as a person living in the United States, to have a choice?
Yes, you do.
To that extent, I want to stay out of it."
"That sums it up," member Cynthia Moore said.
"Well said," member John Sweeney commended.
The district currently forbids the use of tobacco products "in any area utilized by students or designated for student activities."
That gives some leeway for unofficially designated smoking areas for employees at schools in places not visible to students, like a loading dock or a fenced-in space behind a school.
It also allows workers to smoke in their cars.
Employees who work at the other district properties such as the district office, the facilities and maintenance center on Mobley Road, and the bus depot on California Street, have designated smoking areas.
