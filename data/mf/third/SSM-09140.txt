The future of gay marriage
Among a range of options the court will consider is further consideration of Proposition 8; if the justices do nothing to upend the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal's decision to overturn the law, gay and lesbian couples in California would be allowed to legally marry.
What we might learn Monday: The U.S. Supreme Court could reveal whether it will finally weigh in on same-sex marriage.
The justices may announce whether they will review the legality of Proposition 8, California's same-sex marriage ban, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which bars federal benefits to same-sex couples.
Same-sex marriage in California: If the court decides to review the Proposition 8 case, expect a ruling by the end of the term in June.
But if the justices refuse to hear the case, it would leave intact a lower court ruling finding the ban unconstitutional, therefore legalizing gay marriage in the state.
Same-sex marriages could begin within days.
There's also a chance the court could put the Proposition 8 case on hold for now, preserving the status quo in California for months or longer.
Federal benefits for same-sex couples: The court is expected to review at least some of the Defense of Marriage Act cases.
Tune back in Friday?
The court may wait to further mull how to proceed on Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act cases until the justices' next conference, Dec. 7, and issue orders after that.
