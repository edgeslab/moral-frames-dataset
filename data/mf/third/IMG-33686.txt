Ad watch: Romney pushes Obama on immigration promise
Mitt Romney, "Soluciones para la inmigracion"
What it says (translated): "The liberal Democrats promised immigration reform...
Now, the Democrats say they never made a promise ... Romney and the Republicans will fight for bipartisan reform to bring families together."
What it means: Mitt Romney, who trails significantly in polling among Hispanic voters, is trying to turn the tables.
The ad highlights an exchange from Tuesday night's debate in which he confronted Obama over the president's unfulfilled promise of immigration reform.
Who will see it: There's no new ad buy, but Romney has in recent weeks bought ad time in Colorado, Florida and Nevada on Spanish-speaking media.
