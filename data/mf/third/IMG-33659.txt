Immigration a wedge between Obama, Romney
California has almost as many immigrants as swing-state Ohio has people -- more than 10 million.
So the way the president implements immigration policy over the next four years could have a profound impact on families around the state.
President Barack Obama and GOP opponent Mitt Romney agree on one thing: The United States is a "nation of immigrants."
But as last week's fiery presidential debate drove home, the two candidates have clear differences in how they would deal with a Byzantine immigration system that both welcomes and deports hundreds of thousands of people each year.
"Comprehensive immigration reform" through federal legislation has been debated for so long that many political skeptics doubt it will ever happen.
So increasingly, the sometimes unilateral role the president plays in creating immigration policy is emerging as the most salient issue to many immigrants.
Presidents can do a lot on the immigration front even if Congress refuses to take up the issue of comprehensive reform, said Pratheepan Gulasekaram, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law.
The Obama administration, for instance, has "far outstripped its predecessors in terms of year-on-year deportations," Gulasekaram said.
It has also, however, used its executive discretion to do something no president has ever done before: grant deportation relief to a whole class of illegal immigrants who are 30 or younger.
Ju Hong is one of those immigrants.
The 22-year-old UC Berkeley graduate is one of an estimated 350,000 young illegal immigrants in California eligible to apply for the new "deferred action" program, which grants two-year work permits and protection from deportation.
