Maine and Maryland Say 'We Do'

SEATTLE - In the debate over whether two men or two women should be able to make the same kind of legally recognized commitment to each other that a man and a woman routinely (and often cavalierly) do, opponents have leaned with particular enthusiasm on one argument:
The American people just aren't ready for this.
Progressives are getting way ahead of them, showing contempt for true democracy and trying to subvert it.
Same-sex marriage has been enacted only where legislatures or judges swooped in to make it happen.
When citizens themselves, in referendums, have had a voice, they have said no, no and no yet again, more than 30 times in all, even in feel-good, sybaritic California.
They have resisted.
Well, not anymore.
Not even close.
For making history today, for providing what I think will long be remembered as a crucial turning point, Maine and Maryland deserve a round of applause and our heartfelt thanks.
They were among four states with same-sex-marriage referendums this Election Day, and if official projections are correct, they just approved it at the ballot box, where it had never succeeded before.
More than that, they guaranteed an entirely different conversation from now on.
Opponents can no longer broadly and blankly say that the growing number of politicians who support gay marriage are outside the mainstream; that President Obama is outside the mainstream; that opinion polls charting a rapidly increasing favor for same-sex marriage are somehow not reflective of the mainstream.
