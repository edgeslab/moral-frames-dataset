As Victories Pile Up, Gay Rights Advocates Cheer 'Milestone Year'
Gay rights advocates savored multiple victories on Wednesday, with the first election victories for same-sex marriage in Maine, Maryland and Minnesota, the election in Wisconsin of the nation's first openly gay senator and the re-election of President Obama, who had taken a risk by endorsing same-sex marriage.
''It truly was a milestone year,'' said Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, which raised millions of dollars for this year's campaigns.
''We had success across the board and across the country.''
In what some called a clear sign that public opinion was shifting, voters in Maine and Maryland endorsed same-sex marriage, the first time that such rights have been approved at the ballot box.
In Washington State, where ballots on a similar measure were still trickling in by mail, approval maintained a small lead.
Supporters declared victory, saying they were confident that the margin would hold or increase.
While six states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage through judicial or legislative decisions, voters elsewhere had rejected it more than 30 times in a row until Tuesday.
Minnesota residents on Tuesday rejected a proposal to amend the State Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman; similar measures have been enshrined in the constitutions of 30 states.
A state law barring same-sex marriage remains on the books in Minnesota, but with the defeat of the amendment, the door remains open to a change in the law by the Legislature or the courts.
