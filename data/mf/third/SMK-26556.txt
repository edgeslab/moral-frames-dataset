BIG TOBACCO FIGHTS HERNANDO SUIT
John Rizzuto walked slowly into Courtroom F and settled into a chair between his attorneys.
Two more members of his legal team sat behind him amid stacks of boxes and a large poster board still shrouded in plastic.
Across the aisle, attorneys for the tobacco companies Rizzuto is suing readied their own materials.
Then the six people who will decide if the 66-year-old retired letter carrier deserves money from those companies filed into the jury box.
This moment Thursday morning was a long time coming.
Rizzuto filed suit against Philip Morris USA and Liggett Group in 2007, claiming they are partially to blame for his lung disease.
Six years of legal wrangling followed.
This week, Circuit Judge Victor Musleh and attorneys took three days to whittle a jury pool of 300 to six members and an alternate.
In an hourlong opening statement, Tampa lawyer Brent Bigger explained why the companies should pay his client compensatory and punitive damages, even though Rizzuto was the one who put the cigarettes in his mouth for four decades.
"It's shared responsibility, there's no doubt it," Bigger said.
"The only question is what portion belongs to the tobacco companies who created and designed nicotine-delivering devices that were marketed to ensnare teens into addictive substances, and then concealed the health consequences."
Rizzuto is claiming a right to damages as a member of the so-called Engle class.
In 1994, a class-action suit was certified in Miami that became known as the Engle case for lead plaintiff and Miami pediatrician Howard Engle.
