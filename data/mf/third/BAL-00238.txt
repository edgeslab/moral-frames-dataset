ARTICLE
You published two separate articles about two 25-year-old men who chose different paths in their lives.
Freddie Gray, a Baltimore man who had been arrested many times and who died in police custody, was featured on the front page (“Lead paint played key role in early life of Freddie Gray,“ May 1).
However, Officer Brian Moore, a young man who took an oath to protect and serve his community, and who was murdered in cold blood, was mentioned in an inside page (”Suspect held without bail in shooting of N.Y.C.
officer,” May 4).
These two men were from out of town, but you published an article about Joe Fazenbaker, a local young man who was killed in an East Toledo fire and again was back-page news (“East Toledo fire victim set high goals; YMCA teen member wanted to grow kinder,” May 6).
This 14-year-old man chose to have a purpose in life by being thoughtful and joyful, helping the less fortunate and demonstrating kindness.
The Blade needs to stop glorifying criminals and should be ashamed for not putting young Fazenbaker on the front page.
He was someone who deserved more recognition than was given to him.
