Contra Costa Times/Oakland Tribune editorial: Supreme Court right place to decide Prop.
8
The U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to hear arguments on the constitutionality of California's ban on same-sex marriage was not only predictable, but it should be welcomed by both sides.
A decision by the Supreme Court will offer national clarity on a very divisive issue.
We realize that proponents of same-sex marriage were hoping the high court would simply refuse to hear the appeal, thus allowing to stand decisions by a trial court and the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that ruled the state's Proposition 8 unconstitutional.
Proposition 8 effectively banned same-sex marriage in California.
Those who oppose same-sex marriage -- and who favor Proposition 8 -- are understandably overjoyed by the Supreme Court's review.
To them it means that there is one more shot at keeping the ban passed by the voters.
The implications of Friday's decision are fairly simple.
It means that the Supreme Court will schedule arguments in either March or April and will render a verdict by the end of its term in June.
In that decision the court could decide to uphold the 9th Circuit's decision, which would likely have the practical effect of striking down similar bans passed in 31 states.
Such a ruling would be saying that same-sex marriage is an implied constitutional right.
Or, the court could find that the 9th U.S.
Circuit was wrong in affirming District Court Judge Vaughn Walker's finding that the state law did, in fact, violate the U.S. Constitution.
Such a decision would likely center on the argument that there is not such a right -- implied or otherwise -- anywhere in the Constitution.
In that case, the practical effect would be to leave the various state bans in place.
