Dip into the details of the 'anti-Arizona' immigration bill
Assembly Bill 1081, "The Trust Act," would require California law enforcement officers dealing with an illegal immigrant to keep no one on an immigration hold who is eligible for release from criminal custody, unless both of these conditions are satisfied:
The individual has been convicted of a serious or violent felony, according to a criminal-background check or documentation provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The continued detention on an immigration hold would not violate any federal, state or local law -- or any local policy.
It also would require any local government detaining a person on an immigration hold to adopt a plan guarding against:
Detaining a U.S. citizen
Racial profiling
Discouraging crime victims and witnesses from reporting crimes.
