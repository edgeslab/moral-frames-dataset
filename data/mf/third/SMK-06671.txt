Smoking bans may be at odds St. Charles County voters may face 2 proposals in fall, one with many exemptions and another with few.
ST. CHARLES COUNTY - Voters could see two rival smoking ban measures on the November ballot with one exempting the Ameristar Casino and many bars and restaurants.
An initiative petition drive planned by a group of bar and restaurant owners would allow people to light up in businesses barring anyone under age 21.
Another way to get an exemption would be to limit smoking to a ventilated enclosed area.
The effort's organizer, Carl Bearden, a former Republican state representative from the Harvester area, said, "We're trying to preserve the rights of business owners to make the decisions about the business they have an investment in."
The measure is an alternative to an anti-smoking coalition's ongoing push for a much stricter ban covering restaurants, bars and other indoor places, with few exceptions.
When the County Council last year rejected such a measure, the coalition said it might go the petition route.
As of Monday, it had yet to decide but may try to also put it on the November ballot.
Stacy Reliford, an American Cancer Society official, said the Bearden-led group is merely trying to keep the smoking status quo in St. Charles County.
"The goal is to simply provide some permanent loopholes," Reliford said.
"It's really the proactive manipulation of the voters at this point."
Now the only places in the county with strict smoking bans are O'Fallon, its largest city, and Lake Saint Louis.
