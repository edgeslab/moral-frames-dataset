Telephone counseling helps Asian immigrants stop smoking Even though talk therapy is not a familiar concept to recent Asian immigrants to this country, telephone counseling is an effective way to help them quit smoking, a new study shows.
University of California-San Diego researchers developed a telephone "quit line" script that was culturally tailored to Asian attitudes and translated into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese.
The new quit lines were then advertised in Asian media outlets throughout California.
About 2,300 callers were recruited and assigned to receive a self-help quit-smoking manual, with or without telephone counseling consisting of a 40-minute pre-quit session plus five relapse-prevention calls.
Adding counseling more than doubled the six-month abstinence rate, from 8 percent for those who got just the manual to 16.4 percent for the quit-line callers.
All three language groups benefited.
The study, published online this month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, concluded that the counseling "should be incorporated into existing quit lines" - and maybe extended to other Asian languages.

But now, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have found that adding the acid-reflux drug Prevacid to standard asthma medications does not improve asthma symptoms or lung function - not even in children who have been diagnosed with acid reflux.
