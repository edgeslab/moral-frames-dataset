Both sides play mixed ruling to their advantage
Immediately after the Supreme Court rejected parts of  Arizona's controversial immigration law, Democrats claimed vindication.
President Obama was right, they said, to challenge the law.
Republicans  offered a more nuanced position: that the case was a result of Obama's failure to produce the comprehensive solution to immigration that he had promised.
Obama issued a statement declaring himself "pleased that the Supreme Court has struck down key provisions of Arizona's immigration law."
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., declared the ruling proof that the law  "was not just ill-advised but also unconstitutional."
GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney told supporters at a fundraiser in Arizona, "The states, now under this decision, have less authority, less latitude, to enforce immigration law," the Associated Press reported.
In a statement he said, "President Obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration."
The ruling marked the second time in 10 days that  Romney had been forced off his message -- the weak economy is Obama's fault -- to address the immigration issue.
He has yet to say whether he would repeal the president's June 15 decision not to deport some young illegal immigrants.
Charles  Foster, an immigration policy adviser to both President George W. Bush's 2004 campaign and Obama's 2008 campaign, said the decision was a clear win for the Obama administration.
"It's human nature to try to have some face-saving, but there's very little (Republicans) got out of this decision today.
I think it is a huge, huge victory that you cannot understate for the Obama administration," Foster said.
"The Obama administration, after all, was accused of having acted callously by not standing up for the states and by challenging the law."
