Union City mulls lifting tobacco sales buffer for gas stations
UNION CITY -- Two of the City Council's top priorities -- economic development and helping make the city smoke-free -- are coming into conflict as officials consider giving gas stations a pass for selling tobacco products near youth-oriented establishments.
The issue arose after a local gas station owner, Sanjiv Patel, complained that the regulation was hurting his business.
The city's other gas stations already have been "grandfathered in" and are allowed to sell tobacco products.
The Shell service station at 33365 Mission Blvd., however, had been shuttered for a year before Patel reopened it in December 2010, and he didn't qualify for the exemption.
"At present, we are at a competitive disadvantage with Hayward and other locations," he said.
"It's not just affecting our profitability, actually; it's a question of our survival."
Patel says that in his experience, tobacco products make up 40 percent of inside sales for gas stations.
In January 2010, the council prohibited the sale of tobacco products within 1,000 feet of a park, playground, public library, recreation center, religious institution, school or other youth-oriented establishment.
Patel's station is about 450 feet from the Tri-City AME Church on E Street.
Robert Ash, a member of the church's pastoral team, encouraged council members Tuesday night to keep the anti-smoking buffer as is.
"That was a very good idea to have that ordinance in the first place and it's a very bad idea to remove it," he said.
"Our children are our most precious resource, and their health and their surroundings and influences should be paramount to us, and we shouldn't be compromising on that."
