Claim about size of Atlanta's gay population has some merit
"The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities."
Atlanta City Councilman Alex Wan in a resolution passed Dec. 3, 2012
The ongoing national debate about same-sex marriage recently reached the court of opinion inside Atlanta City Hall.
Alex Wan, an openly gay Atlanta city councilman serving his first term, introduced legislation during the City Council's last meeting of 2012 declaring support for marriage equality.
Wan's nonbinding resolution contained several pieces of information to back up his argument.
We thought one statement in particular would be interesting to fact-check.
"The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities," it read.
Atlanta has long been perceived to have one of the largest LGBT populations in the South, if not the nation.
An annual LGBT pride festival draws an estimated 200,000 people.
Several intown neighborhoods have businesses that market heavily to the LGBT community.
Mayoral candidates actively courted LGBT voters during the 2009 campaign.
Wan's resolution passed by an 11-2 vote.
Wan's resolution may have little sway across the street from City Hall among lawmakers who work in the state Capitol.
In 2004, 76 percent of Georgia voters backed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.
The councilman recognized that obstacle, but believes the tide is shifting nationally on the issue and wanted Atlanta to be on the forefront.
Wan said he's unaware of any other Georgia cities that have passed a similar resolution.
