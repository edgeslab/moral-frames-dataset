African Americans and Latinos spur gay marriage revolution; Most demographic groups have been shifting toward supporting gay marriage in recent years, but the most important shift may be among black and Hispanic voters.
Last Tuesday's election was a watershed moment for the gay marriage movement.
Voters in three states voted to legalize it -- something no state had done before -- and a fourth state voted against a proposed ban.
And if the movement catches on in other states, African Americans and Latinos will be a big reason why.
In fact, exit polls now show a majority of both groups now favor gay marriage.
Maine, Maryland and Washington state all passed new gay marriage laws on Tuesday, while voters in Minnesota defeated a ban.
In some ways, the pro-gay marriage votes were a long time coming, with polls showing more and more Americans moving in support of gay marriage in recent years.But the fact that voters in multiple states signed off on gay marriage all at once on Tuesday suggests a significant leap forward, in addition to the incremental progress.
And while the usual suspects continue to favor gay marriage -- young people and non-religious people -- exit polls show the most important shifts in support among two key communities: African Americans and Hispanics.
Black voters, in particular, have been slow to embrace gay marriage, even as the vast majority vote Democratic and the rest of the party has embraced gay marriage.On Tuesday, though, they played a major role in passing Maryland's new gay marriage law.
Maryland is heavily Democratic, which made it a likely candidate to be one of the first states to vote for gay marriage.But the state is also heavily African-American (29 percent) and has a significant Latino population (8 percent), which made passage something less than certain.
