The Justice Department has opened a formal investigation into the Baltimore Police Department to determine whether officers have committed systemic constitutional violations, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced Friday.
The broad investigation, known as a "pattern or practice" review, will focus on the police department's stops, searches and arrests, its use of force, and the question of whether there has been a practice of discriminatory policing.
The review was requested by Baltimore's mayor and will be a "collaborative reform process," Lynch said.
The investigation is separate from the Justice Department's criminal civil rights investigation into the case of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old man whose death while in police custody ignited protests in Baltimore.
Gray suffered a severe spinal injury in the back of a police van while his pleas for medical help were ignored, according to Baltimore prosecutors.
