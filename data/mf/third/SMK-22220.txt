New effort is sought on smoking ban St. Charles Co. Council may decide whether to set a countywide vote on the proposal.
ST. CHARLES COUNTY - Voters would get to decide whether to snuff out smoking, and whether gamblers should be excluded from a ban in bills that county leaders will consider on Monday.
St. Charles County Councilman Joe Cronin, R-St. Paul, said he hopes to persuade a majority on the seven-member council to support the two ballot issues he plans to introduce.
"This effectively lets the two separate, but related, issues be decided by the voters based on their merits," Cronin said in an email Thursday to other council members.
County Executive Steve Ehlmann - who last June blocked a council-endorsed smoking ban from the ballot because it had too many exemptions - says he's likely to allow the new measures to go forward.
The council last May voted 4-2, with one opponent absent, for Cronin's earlier proposal for a smoking ban that exempted Ameristar Casino, which is in St. Charles.
That bill also included some other exceptions.
Ehlmann vetoed the bill, saying there was no rational reason to exclude casino employees from a health ordinance.
He also objected to the other exemptions for similar reasons.
On Thursday, Ehlmann said his preliminary support of Cronin's new approach is consistent with his previous veto.
"The (Missouri) Constitution allows a charter county to let the people decide what the proper scope of the government is to be," through charter amendments, Ehlmann said.
"If this was a health ordinance, I'd still be opposed.
I'm not flip-flopping on this."
