A clear case for compassion
The Oct. 4 Metro article "The only country she's known" reported the story of 31-year-old Lundy Khoy, whose Cambodian-born parents immigrated to the United States when she was 1.
In 2000, Ms. Khoy was arrested for possession with intent to distribute the drug ecstasy, and she served three months in jail and four years of probation.
She has subsequently lived within the law, been employed and is working toward a bachelor's degree in college.
As a resident alien, rather than a citizen, she is threatened with deportation to Cambodia because of the nonviolent crime committed when she was 19.
Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies believes that strict expulsion requirements are necessary because otherwise officials might allow more serious criminals to evade deportation.
Why?
"The abuse of discretion makes it impossible to give the executive this kind of wiggle room," Mr. Krikorian stated.
I understand the need for vigilance against the government limiting people's freedom.
But why do we restrain the government from reasonable leeway in granting freedom?
Shouldn't context and compassion be considered - at least for legal permanent residents?
