Next Civil Rights Landmark
Fifty-eight years after it banned discrimination in public education, the Supreme Court has set the stage for the defining civil rights decision of this era -- agreeing to hear two cases challenging laws that define marriage to exclude couples of the same sex.
To us, and a growing number of Americans, the right course seems clear: that the justices continue the march toward real equality.
In one of the cases, the justices will review a ruling earlier this year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which struck down California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage.
The Supreme Court could leave California's same-sex marriage ban in place, planting the court on the wrong side of justice and equality.
Or, in the absence of a five-vote majority to establish a nationwide constitutional right to same-sex marriage, the Supreme Court could affirm the narrower approach of the Ninth Circuit panel, which was confined to California.
The appellate panel reasoned that Proposition 8, as the voter initiative was known, was unconstitutional because it stripped gays, lesbians and bisexuals of the right to marry declared by the State Supreme Court.
Thus it harmed ''the status and dignity of the members of a disfavored class.''
The second case the Supreme Court will hear is a challenge to Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, the odious 1996 law that denies federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples.
The case concerns Edith Windsor and Thea Clara Spyer of New York, who were married in 2007 in Canada.
