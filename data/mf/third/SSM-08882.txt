Other voices: It's only a matter of time for same-sex marriage
Fairness went 4-for-4 on Election Day.
Let's keep the streak going so everyone can marry the person he or she loves.
Maine, Maryland and Washington made history as the first states to approved same-sex marriage by popular vote.
Minnesota voters also rejected a constitutional ban.
Six additional states -- Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont -- already let gay couples marry because of legislative or legal decisions.
But Tuesday's results were hugely significant and telling because the people, not the politicians or judges, decided the question.
Moreover, polls suggest it's only a matter of time before every state -- including Wisconsin -- does the right and fair thing.
So much has changed in such a short time since 59 percent of Wisconsin voters adopted a constitutional ban on gay marriage in 2006.
Just look at Tuesday's U.S. Senate race, in which Wisconsin made some history of its own.
Voters elected U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, to become the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate.
Her sexual orientation was hardly mentioned during the race.
And she won by nearly as wide of a margin as Democratic President Barack Obama.
Electing a gay leader isn't the same as approving gay marriage.
And Tuesday's election, unlike 2006, featured a presidential race in which more young people participated.
The younger generation has favored gay marriage for years.
