Smokey & the bandits Meet borough's biggest violators of cig ban
A BENSONHURST lounge, a Gowanus veterans' hangout and Borough Park karaoke joint topped the list of Brooklyn's smoking speakeasies.
CafeÃÅ Jonny's Lounge was hit with 14 smoking violations, more than any other spot in the borough, over the past two years, according to a Daily News analysis of Health Department data.
The club at 38 Ave. O was nailed by city inspectors 12 separate times since 2010, with the most recent butt bust in June 2012, records show.
The runner-up was the American Legion Post 1636 at 193 Ninth St., where puffing patriots racked up 10 violations from Jan. 1, 2011 through March 16, 2013.
"If they don't follow the law they should shut them down," said Robert Morrill, the Legion's finance director in Albany.
"Maybe that will teach them a lesson."
The city previously allowed club members to smoke inside, but Post leaders failed to renew their "membership association" waiver, which would have allowed them to smoke inside.
The Bloomberg administration insists that enforcement has not been increased, but the number of smoking violations citywide rose last year by about 70%.
Whatever the case, one community leader argued that the nicotine-addled veterans at the American Legion should be left alone.
"No one has made a complaint to us about it," said Craig Hammerman, the district manager of Community Board 6.
"I don't know why it's a problem and why it has become one.
It seems bizarre to me that the city would go out of their way to target what in effect is a private organization."
