2 states OK same-sex marriage; Marijuana measures also gain approval
Maine and Maryland made history Tuesday, becoming the first states in which voters legalized same-sex marriage.
In Washington state and Colorado, voters adopted landmark measures of their own -- becoming the first states to legalize recreational use of marijuana.
A bill allowing same-sex marriages in Maine passed in 2009, but opponents petitioned for a referendum on the issue and that year 53% of voters opposed it.
In Maryland a referendum had sought to overturn a law approving same-sex marriage passed earlier this year by the Legislature.
A similar vote was underway in Washington state.
In Minnesota, voters were being asked whether the state's constitution should ban same-sex marriage, a step beyond the state's existing law against gay marriage.
Across the nation, voters in 38 states were deciding sweeping ballot initiatives on everything from same-sex marriage and recreational marijuana use to whether genetically engineered foods should be labeled.
Nationally, 32 states have voted to restrict marriage to heterosexual couples while while six others -- New York, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont -- and the District of Columbia have legalized it either by legislation or a judicial ruling.
In addition to Washington and Colorado, the recreational use of marijuana was up for a vote in Oregon.
Two others were considering allowing pot use for medical reasons.
The Washington measure that was adopted  would allow adults to possess small amounts of marijuana and also allow its sale to be regulated and taxed.
Estimates have showed pot taxes could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but the sales won't start until state officials make rules to govern the legal weed industry.
