IMMIGRATION RULING; 'Papers' provision provides safeguard
A federal appeals court's ruling that allows Georgia to enforce its "show-me-your-papers" provision has critics of illegal immigration declaring victory and proponents vowing to continue fighting the law.
Catherine Davis, legislative director for the Network of Politically Active Christians, fields questions about Georgia's immigration law.
Q: Do you think the "show-me-your-papers" provision of the law opens the gate for racial profiling?
A: Absolutely not.
This law is more restrictive on law enforcement than is found in most racial profiling cases.
The Georgia law says local law enforcement investigating suspected violations of state or federal crimes can investigate immigration status of suspects who cannot provide proof of lawful presence.
The focus should be on the fact the individual being investigated cannot provide proper ID, a violation of existing federal law ...
I think it is a common-sense tool.
Q: How can this provision not lead to racial profiling?
A: For it to be racist, every police officer who requests information on the legal status of someone who cannot show identification would have to be Caucasian.
That is far from the case, especially in counties like Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb.
"Illegal" is not a race.
The law was created to make Georgia an inhospitable place for people who violate immigration laws.
Q: What are your thoughts on Georgia's immigration law in general?
A: The main cause of illegal immigration is illegal employment.
We need to tighten the E-Verify mandates and crack down on local governments and agency heads who are ignoring parts of the laws already on the books.
