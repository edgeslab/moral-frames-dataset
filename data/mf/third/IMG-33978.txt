Young illegal immigrants will be eligible for California driver's licenses
California will issue driver's licenses to hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants once the Obama administration grants them work permits, a move that could reignite a divisive debate that has simmered for nearly 20 years.
The state's decision is the opposite from Arizona's, where Republican Gov.
Jan Brewer signed an executive order outlawing driver's licenses for anyone who benefits from the new federal deportation relief.
The starkly different responses show that the benefits of the federal directive could vary depending on where immigrants live.
The Obama administration left it to states to decide whether to issue driver's licenses and offer in-state college tuition rates and other services to people who came here illegally as children but now are eligible for work permits.
Arizona was the first to say no, and California -- home to more than 400,000 young immigrants expected to qualify -- was one of the first to say yes when deportation relief became available this week.
Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute expects a flurry of activity in state capitals this month as governors and lawmakers follow the lines drawn by California and Arizona.
"Immigration is a federal issue," Chishti said.
"How you treat immigrants within your state is a state issue."
Licenses also are purely a state matter, another expert said.
"The Constitution says nothing about driver's licenses," said Jacob Vigdor, a professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy.
"Back in the 1780s it wasn't an issue.
So it's completely at the discretion of states."
