N.J. lawmakers still struggle with same-sex marriage issue
TRENTON - Supporters of same-sex marriage celebrated this week when voters in three states approved gay marriage and those in a fourth state blocked an effort to ban it.
But Tuesday's results have not persuaded lawmakers to put the question of marriage equality on the ballot in New Jersey, a decision supported by the largest gay rights organization in the state as well as a leading U.S. same-sex marriage advocacy organization.
"It would be a terrible road for New Jersey to go down," Evan Wolfson, a civil rights lawyer and founder and president of Freedom to Marry, a national gay-marriage group, said Thursday.
Campaigning for the ballot question would involve "a huge amount of work and money and time and nervousness that nobody should have to go through."
New Jersey's Democratic-controlled Legislature in February approved a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, which Republican Gov.
Christie promptly vetoed.
Voters should decide the issue, he said.
But legislative leaders have refused to heed his call, arguing that a voting majority should never determine the rights for a minority group.
"I think a same-sex marriage referendum would have passed in this presidential election," Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D., Bergen) said Thursday.
"But as far as I'm concerned, we don't put civil rights issues on the ballot.

I just don't believe that that's how civil rights that should be constitutionally afforded to our citizens should be decided."
