Attitudes toward gays changing fast, poll finds; 91% of gay men and lesbians see greater acceptance
In the wake of historic victories for gay-rights supporters in last month's elections, a pair of USA TODAY/Gallup Polls find growing acceptance among Americans toward gay men and lesbians -- and soaring optimism among gay Americans that issues involving homosexuality will one day no longer divide the nation.
In a survey of respondents who identified themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, three of four say they are generally open with others about their sexual orientation.
More than nine of 10 say people in their community have become more accepting in recent years.
That feeling is ratified in a  USA TODAY poll of all Americans that finds broad acceptance of economic rights for same-sex couples and majority support for gay marriage and adoption.
A 51% majority predict that at some point, the country will reach an accord on such issues.
The changes echo times when attitudes toward blacks  and women were in flux, scholars say.
With young adults by far the most supportive of gay rights -- among those 18 to 29 years old, 73% endorse same-sex marriage -- the trend seems more likely to accelerate than reverse.
More than a third of Americans  say their views have changed significantly over time toward gay marriage, an issue being battled in states  and before the Supreme Court.
The high court could announce as early as Friday whether it will accept cases challenging California's Proposition 8 and the  Defense of Marriage Act, which bars federal programs from recognizing same-sex marriages.
