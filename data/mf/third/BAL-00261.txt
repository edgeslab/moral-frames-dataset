Thousands of people have been brought to the Baltimore city jail in recent years with injuries too severe for them to be admitted, newly released records show.
The records, obtained by the Baltimore Sun through a Maryland Public Information Act request, show that correctional officers at the Baltimore City Detention Center refused to admit nearly 2,600 detainees who were in police custody between June 2012 and April 2015.
The records do not indicate how the people were injured or whether they were injured while in custody.
Baltimore police are under scrutiny after the April 19 death of Freddie Gray, whose spine was severed while he was riding in a police van, prosecutors say.
Six officers involved in Gray's arrest face criminal charges, including one charged with second-degree murder.
