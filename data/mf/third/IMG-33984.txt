ARIZONA          Illegal immigrants to be refused benefits
Arizona Gov.
Jan Brewer (R), in yet another clash with the White House, issued an order on Wednesday barring illegal immigrants who qualify for temporary legal status in the United States from receiving any state or local public benefits.
The action was a response to relaxed deportation rules issued by the Obama administration on Wednesday.
Brewer, whose state has been at the center of the country's immigration debate, issued an executive order denying state or local benefits to immigrants applying under the new federal immigration rules.
The order would bar them from obtaining an Arizona driver's license or a state- issued identification card.
As many as 1.7 million people could qualify for the temporary federal program, which enables certain illegal immigrants to apply for work permits, Social Security cards and driver's licenses, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.
Applying for "deferred action for child arrivals" permits will shield some young illegal immigrants from being ousted from the United States for at least two years.
In Arizona, officials said an estimated 80,000 illegal immigrants were eligible to apply.
Brewer wrote in the order that the new program "does not confer upon them any lawful or authorized status and does not entitle them to any additional public benefits."
She said she was reaffirming the intent of current Arizona laws, and preventing "significant and lasting impacts on the Arizona budget, its health-care system and additional public benefits that Arizona taxpayers fund."
