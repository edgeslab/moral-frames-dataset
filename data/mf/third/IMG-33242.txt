Letters to the Editor: Recession not a time to pander on immigration
Recession not a time to pander on immigration
The president continues to reinterpret the law by ignoring Congress and his own statement in 2011, that he could not suspend deportation through executive order.
That was then, from a president whose many pronouncements have unpredictable expiration dates.
We are reminded that we are a nation of immigrants whose definition becomes blurred when immigration laws are not enforced.
We are also a nation of laws, that is until President Obama decides otherwise, demonstrating his contempt for the rule of law.
The Obama administration is again pandering with its latest political move to bolster the president's re-election campaign by adding millions of illegal young workers to the legal workforce of Americans of all ages and veterans returning home.
But, where are those jobs?
The president prefers to create new crises, insisting on keeping his failed policies moving "Forward" to the point of creating the worst recession since the last depression.
U.S. presidents don't whine, they Lead!

What message was Obama trying to send?
President Obama recently awarded Dolores Huerta with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Is he trying to showcase her as a role model for American women, or is he just letting everyone know that he appreciates that "birds of a feather flock together?
I'll be very interested as to how your paper answers that question.
