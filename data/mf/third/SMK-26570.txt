Wisconsin growers give Maryland tobacco a try
Larry Oberdeck stood in his 3-acre tobacco field west of Edgerton, Wis., last week, inspecting his maturing crop.
He eyed his flowering Wisconsin-variety plants, with their tall, deep green leaves standing prone beneath dusty-pink flowers.
It's the type of tobacco -- loose-leaf chewing tobacco -- that Oberdeck and other area growers have been raising for decades.
Yet this year, mixed in with that crop is a totally different breed of tobacco.
It has broad, droopy leaves that feel velvety to the touch.
It's squat -- about half the height of Wisconsin tobacco.
It's Maryland tobacco -- a variety manufacturers use in cigarettes and pipes, growers and local tobacco dealers say.
It's a different tobacco crop from anything Edgerton-area growers have ever tried, and it's the first time in the area's history that farmers have grown tobacco used for smoking.
Oberdeck first tried a half-acre of Maryland tobacco last year, and he has upgraded that to an acre this year.
He still finds the new crop odd to look at.
"The plants, they just look different," he said.
"It's a totally different thing."
Oberdeck is one of a dwindling group of farmers in northern Rock County who still grow tobacco.
Once the financial backbone of Edgerton, chewing tobacco was a cash crop that dominated fields, made millionaires out of local merchants in the late 1800s, and for decades helped put farm kids through college.
