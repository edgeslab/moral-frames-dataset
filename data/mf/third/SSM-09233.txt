Pataki slams rabbi-rousing over gay nups
ALBANY - Former Gov.
George Pataki ripped an upstate rabbi for making "offensive and disgraceful" comments that described Hurricane Sandy as divine payback for New York legalizing gay marriage.
Pataki called on fellow Republican Neil DiCarlo - who is running on the Conservative Party line for a state Senate seat from the Hudson Valley - to denounce the remarks of Rabbi Noson Leiter.
DiCarlo opposes gay marriage, and the orthodox rabbi made the statements in support of his third-party candidacy.
"It's simply incomprehensible that anyone could attribute the devastation and loss of life caused by Hurricane Sandy to divine retribution against the New York State legislature," Pataki railed.
"It's like blaming America's belief in freedom for the attacks of Sept. 11," Pataki added.
The former three-term Republican governor has supported some gay rights issues, but opposed same-sex marriage.
Rabbi Leiter, head of Torah Jews for Decency, made the comments during an Oct. 30 radio interview.
He called the destructive storm "divine justice," particularly for lower Manhattan, which he branded "one of the national centers for homosexuality."
He equated Sandy to the biblical storm that prompted Noah to build his ark.
"The Lord will not bring another flood to destroy the entire world, but he can punish particular areas with that flood, and if we look at the same-gender-marriage recognition movement that's occurring, that's certainly a message for us to learn," Leiter opined.
