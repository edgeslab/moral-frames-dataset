Attorneys for the six Baltimore police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray are asking to have the case dismissed or have Baltimore State's Atty.
Marilyn Mosby's office taken off the case.
Gray died from an injury that partially severed his spine, according to an autopsy report.
The motion, filed Friday, argues that Mosby and one of her chief assistant prosecutors have personal relationships that would qualify as conflicts of interest in the case.
Mosby's husband, City Councilman Nick Mosby, represents the neighborhood where Gray was arrested.
