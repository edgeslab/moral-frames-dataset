Loretta Lynch is wasting no time going after her first scalp.
The new US attorney general - who took office 11 days earlier - said Friday the Justice Department would launch a civil rights probe of the Baltimore Police following the death of Freddie Gray in custody.
"This investigation will begin immediately and will focus on allegations that Baltimore Police Department officers use excessive force, including deadly force, conduct unlawful searches, seizures and arrests, and engage in discriminatory policing," Lynch said at the Justice Department.
The wide-ranging probe was necessary, she added, because already "frayed" relations between cops and the city's minority community were "severed" by Gray's death, which sparked an orgy of rioting, looting and arson.
"This process is meant to ensure that officers are being provided with the tools they need - including training, policy guidance and equipment - to be more effective, to partner with civilians, and to strengthen public safety," said Lynch, who was US Attorney in Brooklyn before President Obama nominated her to replace Eric Holder.
Meanwhile, lawyers for the six cops charged in the death of Gray demanded State Attorney Marilyn Mosby be kicked off the case, according to a motion filed in Baltimore City District Court Friday.
The lawyers claim in court papers that she stands to gain politically from the case and brought "overzealous" charges "in the face of continued riots," NBC reported.
