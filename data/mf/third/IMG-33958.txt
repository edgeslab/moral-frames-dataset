Reform changes little for many
For thousands of undocumented immigrants who rushed to apply for new protections from deportation, Wednesday was the life-changing day many had dreamed of for years.
But for most, it was just Wednesday.
"I will be working today, that's all, if I can get work," said Ricardo Cruz, 22, a Salvadoran day laborer gathered with other job seekers in a parking lot on New Hampshire Avenue in Langley Park.
"I have heard of this program, but they said it was not for me."
Advocates hailed President Obama's offer of temporary residency and work status to some young immigrants as the most significant reform in a generation.
But, as some have learned as the details became clear, it is a narrowly tailored one.
Fewer than 2 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country are eligible for the program, known as deferred action, which began accepting applications Wednesday.That leaves life in the shadows to continue unchanged for the rest.
For many who have been waiting to learn the final details of the program, its launch brought crushing disappointment.
"It was devastating to hear I didn't qualify," said a sobbing Elsi Hernandez after her visit to Carecen of Columbia Heights.
Hernandez, 25, came to the United States when she was 17 and graduated from high school in 2008.
She only learned while gathering documents to apply that she was too old when she arrived from El Salvador to be eligible.
"I just want to study and be a good example to my daughters."
