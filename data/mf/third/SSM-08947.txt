The attack issuethat never showed up
Sometimes in politics, you have to listen for what's not being said to understand how things really stand.
In the 2012 presidential campaign, the telling - and comforting - silence involves same-sex marriage and gay rights.
Think about it: In 1992, Pat Buchanan, speaking at the Republican convention in Houston, warned that Bill Clinton wanted to impose a "homosexual rights" agenda on America.
In 2004, Republicans engineered ballot initiatives against same-sex marriage in 11 states, hoping to bolster George W. Bush's reelection chances by spurring conservatives to go to the polls.
It may not have worked - former Bush adviser Matthew Dowd has written that the initiatives "had no discernable effect on turnout among conservatives" - but those ballot initiatives didn't turn up by accident.
Flash-forward to 2012.
President Obama pushed to lift the ban on gays serving openly in the military, undoing the "don't ask/don't tell" policy put in place by the last Democratic president.
He instructed the Justice Department to stop defending the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), also signed into law by President Clinton.
Obama completed his slow evolution on same-sex marriage and came out in support.
The platform approved at the Democratic convention in Charlotte included a plank supporting same-sex marriage.
Last week, Obama urged voters to back initiatives in Maryland, Maine and Washington state to allow gay couples to marry; he had previously urged Minnesotans to vote against a marriage prohibition.
