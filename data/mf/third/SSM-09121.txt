U.S. Supreme Court to review Proposition 8 gay marriage case
The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday decided to tackle the same-sex marriage issue head on, agreeing to review the legal challenge to California's Proposition 8 and another case involving the federal government's ban on benefits for same-sex couples.
In brief orders released after their closed-door conference, the Supreme Court justices decided to review a federal appeals court's ruling earlier this year striking down Proposition 8, California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage.
As a result, the court would rule on the case by the end of its term in June.
In the meantime, same-sex marriage remains on hold in California.
The court is expected to hear arguments in the case in mid to late March.
The high court also agreed to review a federal appeals court ruling finding the federal Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional.
That case involved a New York woman who was forced to pay estate taxes after her spouse died because the federal government refused to recognize their marriage under DOMA.
The Obama administration has told the Supreme Court it considers the federal law unconstitutional, but House Republicans have jumped in to urge the high court to uphold the anti-gay marriage provisions.
Proposition 8 supporters were pleased the Supreme Court agreed to hear their arguments.
"Every one of the numerous legal steps we have taken for the past four years has been in anticipation of this moment," said Andrew Pugno, general counsel forProtectMarriage.com .
"We are delighted the nation's highest court will decide whether to uphold the will of more than seven million Californians who voted to preserve the unique definition of marriage as only between one man and one woman."
