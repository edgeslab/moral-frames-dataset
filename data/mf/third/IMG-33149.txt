ROMNEY vs. OBAMA on immigration
Because of the Supreme Court's ruling on Arizona's immigration law, the weak economy and the Obama administration's announcement that it will not deport certain young illegal immigrants, immigration is at the forefront of the presidential campaign.
Statements from the two candidates reveal contrasting yet overlapping visions.
PRESIDENT OBAMA
Today, there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants here in the United States.
Some crossed the border illegally.
Others avoid immigration laws by overstaying their visas.
Regardless of how they came, the overwhelming majority of these folks are just trying to earn a living and provide for their families.
But we have to acknowledge they've broken the rules.
They've cut in front of the line.
And what is also true is that the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are trying to immigrate legally.

Over the next few months, eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.
Now, let's be clear - this is not amnesty, this is not immunity.
This is not a path to citizenship.
It's not a permanent fix.
This is a temporary stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people.
It is the right thing to do.
