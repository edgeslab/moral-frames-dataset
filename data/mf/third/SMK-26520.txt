NYC can't try to deter smokers with images
New York City cannot try to scare smokers by requiring grotesque images of diseased lungs and decaying gums at stores that sell cigarettes, an appeals court ruled Tuesday.
The 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the federal government, not the city, decides how to warn people about the dangers of smoking tobacco.
The court rejected a 2009 city Board of Health resolution requiring tobacco retailers to display signs with graphic images showing the adverse health effects of smoking.
The  court said the resolution is pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, enacted in 1965.
Cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris USA, which sued to block the requirement, said it's pleased with the ruling.
The city's health department said the ruling is likely to reduce the number of smokers who quit.
Scranton public workers fight pay cut
Public employee unions in Scranton, Pa., sought to have the mayor held in contempt of court after he defied a judge and slashed workers' pay to minimum wage.
Unions representing firefighters, police and public-works employees also filed a pair of federal lawsuits against Mayor Chris Doherty and the city, alleging violations of labor law and due-process rights.
Last week, Doherty ignored a court order and cut the pay of about 400 city workers to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.
He said it was all the cash-strapped city of more than 76,000 could afford and promised to restore full pay once finances are stabilized.
