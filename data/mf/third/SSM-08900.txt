For a change, gay rights activists welcome Election Day results
On Tuesday, American politics became much more gay-friendly.
Wisconsin voters elected a lesbian senator.
Three gay men, and potentially one bisexual woman, will join the House of Representatives.
And the approval of ballot initiatives means homosexuals can marry in three more states.
The gay rights movement had come to dread election days, when voters often reversed measures that legislatures and governors had backed.
And opponents of same-sex marriage consistently won decisive statewide votes with far less money and manpower than its advocates.
As recently as May, North Carolina voters delivered another drubbing in a string of 30-plus statewide losses for gay-marriage activists, adding the state's ban on same-sex marriage to its constitution.
In Tuesday's vote, those advocates welcomed a different result.
"Winning for the first time at the ballot box in Maryland, Maine, Minnesota and Washington is truly historic," said Chad Griffin, who recently took over the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nation's largest gay rights organization.
"You're seeing how fair-minded Americans are, coming down on the side of full equality and inclusion in this country."
Griffin attributed the win to new gay-straight alliances - outreach efforts with church leaders, African American activists, corporations and business leaders.
Many prominent executives took the risk of alienating their customer base and ponied up chunks of their own fortunes, including the founders of Amazon and Microsoft in Washington state.
The chief executive of General Mills, Ken Powell, spoke for his company against a same-sex marriage ban in the conglomerate's home state of Minnesota.
