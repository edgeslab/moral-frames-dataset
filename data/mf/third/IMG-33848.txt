Lawyer Says Man's Link To Legislator Led to Arrest
A lawyer for an Israeli immigrant who raised thousands of dollars that helped elect Michael G. Grimm to Congress in 2010 said Friday that the authorities arrested his client last month on a charge of immigration fraud because of his ties to the lawmaker.
''This case is politically motivated,'' the lawyer, John Meringolo, said at a midday bail hearing in federal court in Brooklyn for his client, Ofer Biton.
''He did not profit one nickel, your honor,'' from this alleged crime, the lawyer told United States Magistrate Judge Cheryl L. Pollak.
While the authorities have charged Mr. Biton with misrepresenting $400,000 on a visa application, Mr. Meringolo argued that ''no one in the public'' had money taken from them and ''there's never been allegations of a violent crime.''
Outside court, after Mr. Biton was denied bail, Mr. Meringolo explained why he thinks prosecutors are focusing on his client, ''They say he has ties to Michael Grimm,'' he said.
''I haven't seen any evidence whatsoever of wrongdoing of Michael Grimm.''
Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, which is prosecuting the case, had a different analysis in responding to the lawyer's allegation.
''The case,'' he said, ''is motivated by the evidence.''
In fact, Anthony Capozzolo, a federal prosecutor at the public corruption unit of the United States attorney's office, said in court that this was ''not a simple visa fraud.''
