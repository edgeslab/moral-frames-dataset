Realtors discuss growing international purchases
Low prices and the relative weakness of the dollar are attracting international buyers to property in the U.S.
According to the National Association of Realtors' 2012 Profile of International Home Buying Activity, total residential international sales in the U.S. for the past year ending March 2012 equaled $82.5 billion, up from $66.4 billion in 2011.
Total international sales were evenly split between non-resident foreigners and recent immigrants.
International buyers bought homes throughout the country, but four states accounted for 51 percent of the purchases:Florida, California, Texas and Arizona.
California came in second to Florida, accounting for 11 percent of foreign purchases.
International buyers from Canada, China (The People's Republic of China, including Hong Kong), Mexico, India and the United Kingdom accounted for 55 percent of all international transactions.
A program jointly presented by the Women's Council of Realtors Santa Clara Valley Chapter and the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors recently discussed the growing foreign interest in Silicon Valley properties.
Jennifer Tasto and Juliana Lee, who work with foreign buyers, said Asian buyers tend to purchase property in California because of the proximity to their home countries, the presence of relatives and friends, and climate.
Many immigrants view home ownership as one way to get established in this country.
"Land is a premium in some countries," said Tasto.
In some countries, home ownership is not an option.
"In China, the government owns and controls the land.
True home ownership, as we know it, is not possible," explained Lee.
"When foreigners consider buying property here, they often ask if the land is included."
