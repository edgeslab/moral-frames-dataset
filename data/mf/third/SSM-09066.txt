Legally sound, morally just
With the Supreme Court's announcement last week that it would take up two cases concerning same-sex marriage, there's a chance for a sweeping ruling that would extend the right to marry to gay couples nationwide.
Such a grand decision may be unlikely, but it is something to hope for.
After years of debate from state to state, it is time for the Supreme Court to recognize same-sex marriage as a constitutional right.
Denying to homosexuals the same ability to be legally married as heterosexuals violates the Constitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law.
Florida is one of 37 states that ban same-sex marriage by defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.
Nine states, along with Washington D.C., allow same-sex marriage.
Five states, including three that ban marriage, allow civil unions that extend to gay couples the same spousal rights as marriage.
The legal challenge to the constitutionality of same-sex marriage arose in California.
Voters there approved a ban on civil marriages in 2008.
Prominent conservative attorney Theodore Olson and prominent liberal attorney David Boies, representing gay-rights advocates, challenged the ban, arguing that homosexual couples deserve the same right to marry that heterosexuals have.
A federal judge agreed, and an appeals court upheld the decision.
Also before the Supreme Court will be a case from New York state that centers on whether the federal government can deny spousal benefits to same-sex spouses in states where same-sex marriages are permitted.
The justices could rule many ways on this combination of cases, but the growing public acceptance of same-sex marriage, revealed in polls and last month's election results, signals the nation's readiness for a definitive statement.
