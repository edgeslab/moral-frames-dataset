Short take: No smoking, except in corncob pipe factory and hookah bar
The city of Washington, the sensible one on the Missouri River in Franklin County, not the other one, has adopted an indoor-smoking ordinance.
Come April 15, smoking will be prohibited inside workplaces and public spaces.
In a great burst of common sense, the city council this week exempted two workplaces: one, the city's new hookah lounge, and two, the city's 143-year-old corncob pipe factory.
Somehow it's reassuring that a city can have both a place for hipsters and a place that makes implements for the decidedly unhip.
But who knows?
The products of the Missouri Meerschaum Co. could become hip again now that the movie "Emperor" has opened nationwide.
There's Tommy Lee Jones as Gen. Douglas MacArthur, with his Missouri Meerschaum (a dozen exact replicas were manufactured for the movie) and who's hipper than Al Gore's Harvard roommate?
The people who make the 3,500 pipes each day won't be allowed to smoke in the factory.
The privilege is reserved for a special "demonstration area."
The staff may have to hit the hookah lounge after work.
