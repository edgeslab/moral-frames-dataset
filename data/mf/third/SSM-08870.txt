After historic vote, a happier challenge: Wedding plans
In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Joseph Smith asked his partner of 24 years what he wanted to do if Maryland voters approved same-sex marriage.
"When it passes, we'll talk about it," Don Starr, a George Mason University professor, told Smith, the first openly gay member of the Havre de Grace City Council.
The prospect of marrying is no longer a maybe.
Over dinner Wednesday, Starr looked across the table at Smith and said, matter-of-factly, "I guess we'll talk about it now."
Practical discussions of whether and when to marry are now underway in many of the Maryland households in which, census statistics show, 12,500 same-sex couples already form a family.
Some couples already were     legally wed in the District or the handful of states where gay marriage is legal.
Other long-standing couples united in commitment ceremonies.
Many are now considering intimate civil weddings to ensure that they have the legal protections that marriage affords.
Same-sex weddings are unlikely to cause a rush to the circuit court clerk's offices on Jan. 2, the day after the law takes effect, when marriage certificates will be issued.
But they almost certainly will become more common.
Studies suggest that half the same-sex couples living together when gay marriage becomes legal will marry within three years.
Jason Gedeik and Evan Glass plan to get a marriage license just after New Year's Day, even though they committed to each another before 120 people three years ago at Woodend Sanctuary in Chevy Chase.
