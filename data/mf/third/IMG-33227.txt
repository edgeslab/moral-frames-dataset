President's action shows leadership
President Barack Obama's executive order to halt deportations of immigrants brought to the United States as children demonstrates leadership.
Allowing these people to obtain permits, legally work and, therefore, pay income tax benefits both them and our nation.
The president correctly called this change "the right thing to do" to make immigration policy "more fair, more efficient and more just."
No one can show any benefit in deporting some 800,000 people who graduated from American high schools and are eager to contribute to the country as far as the law allows.
Since even immigration foes propose no means of doing this, apparently they want these American-raised young people to live as a permanent underclass.
The same congressional Republicans who accuse Obama of misusing his executive authority have raised obstructionism to unprecedented heights.
Only a GOP-led filibuster prevented the DREAM Act from becoming law in 2010.
Mitt Romney criticizes the timing but can't bring himself to say whether he approves of the decision.
While his critics bicker and dodge tough questions, the president is leading.

President cannot give such an order
I disagree with the president's executive order on immigration.
An executive order by the commander in chief applies only to troops, not civilians.
Only Congress can make laws.
In 1948, President Harry Truman integrated the troops.
It took an act of Congress to integrate civilians.
