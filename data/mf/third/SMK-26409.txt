PROP B NO!
You can be pro-education and vote no on Prop B Tobacco tax o Outrageous 760 percent tax increase has no guarantee of more education funding.
OTHER VIEWS
Proposition B's outrageous and unfair 760 percent tax increase, the largest tax increase in Missouri's history, is not about education or health care.
It's about greedy special interest groups, responsible tax policies, the proper size and scope of government and politicians wasting even more of your tax dollars.
Misleading statistics.
Tobacco and health care statistics are irrelevant to the Prop B debate since not one single dime of Prop B is required to be spent on actually treating tobacco-related diseases.
Not one single dime.
Shouldn't a "sin tax" be used to cure the "sin"?
Education money will be diverted - again.
The state's budget is a shell game, and there is no "lock box" guarantee that Prop B will actually increase education funding.
Remember the broken education funding promises that came with the Lottery and casinos?
Don't be fooled again.
Everyone will pay the $67 million-plus tab.
Prop B increases government spending by hundreds of millions of dollars per year, could be used to expand welfare and fund "Obamacare," and a leading economist predicts a decrease in tobacco sales alone will decrease state and local sales and other tax revenues by at least $67 million per year.
The middle class will pay this tab forever - just like always.
Slush fund for greedy political insiders.
Prop B sets up a panel of nine unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats who control hundreds of millions of tax dollars.
Prop B even allows these insiders to pay their friends and pocket this tax money.
