Jury awards Delray Beach man $1.2M from tobacco companies for wife's death from smoking; Jury decides tobacco firms owe widower $1.2 million
Gripping his walker and smiling broadly, 91-year-old David Cohen on Thursday praised a Palm Beach County jury for helping him avenge his wife's death.
After deliberating for roughly five hours over two days, the six jurors ordered three of the nation's biggest cigarette-makers to pay the Delray Beach man $1.2 million for turning his wife into a hopeless nicotine addict, which ultimately led to her death from lung cancer at age 81.
"Justice has been served," he said.
"She would have demanded it."
The jurors held Helen Cohen 40 percent responsible for her own death, apparently finding that she should have quit long before her lungs were hopelessly damaged.
That shaved $800,000 off the $2 million they said David Cohen deserved for enduring his wife's slow and painful descent -- from emphysema in the 1990s to her 2006 death.
While the $1.2 million is far less than his attorneys asked for, neither they nor Cohen voiced any disappointment.
Attorney Scott Schlesinger, who represented Cohen during the nearly monthlong trial, praised his elderly client for toughing it out against great odds.
"More people have climbed Mount Everest than have gotten verdicts against tobacco companies," he said.
Attorneys for R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard and Liggett declined comment.
Philip Morris was not held responsible for Cohen's death.
Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Meenu Sasser ruled that Cohen rarely smoked its brands.
