New regs for shady notaries
ALBANY - State officials want to crack down on notaries who bilk immigrants by portraying themselves as legal experts.
New regulations announced Wednesday would prohibit notaries public from falsely claiming to be lawyers or immigration specialists in foreign language advertisements.
They would also need to include the disclaimer: "I am not an attorney licensed to practice law and may not give legal advice about immigration or any other legal matter or accept fees for legal advice."
In some languages, the term "notary public" implies that a person is an attorney, and scammers have often charged immigrants excessive fees to prepare documents and legal papers, which they are not authorized to do, state officials said.
The new regulations, which become effective in three months, include $1,000 fines and license suspensions for violators.
"New York State can finally look forward to the day when the notario fraud reference is no longer part of its lexicon," said New York Secretary of State Cesar Perales.
