State Considers Vehicle Smoking Ban
ON Wednesday, the Maryland Senate passed a bill that would prohibit smoking in vehicles when transporting a child under 8 years old, a move to protect children from secondhand smoke.
If the bill is approved by the House and eventually enacted into law, Maryland would join a number of other states to ban smoking in vehicles when children are inside.
According to a Feb. 1 report by the New Jersey-based nonprofit Global Advisers on Smokefree Policy, which advocates for smoking bans nationwide, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Maine and Puerto Rico have enacted bans, as have numerous local governments, including Rockland County, N.Y.; Keyport, N.J.; and Monroe County, Ind.
Many laws are more restrictive than that proposed by the Maryland Senate, with the age threshold for protected children extending to 14 to 18 in most jurisdictions.
In New York, State Senator Toby Ann Stavisky and Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn sponsored a similar bill in 2010 that would have applied to children 14 and younger.
Ms. Mayersohn is no longer a member of the assembly, but Assemblyman David I. Weprin is co-sponsoring the bill.
In a telephone interview, Ms. Stavisky said the bill introduced by Mr. Weprin made it out of the Assembly's health committee and was referred to the code committee.
She expects it to come up for a vote after the state's budget issues have been resolved.
