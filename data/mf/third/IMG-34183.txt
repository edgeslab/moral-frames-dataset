Ruben Navarrette: GOP dug its own hole with Latinos
SAN DIEGO -- After years of lecturing us about not making excuses and taking responsibilities for our actions, Republicans are now playing the victim.
They claim they're getting a bad rap as being hostile to immigrants and Latinos.
The two groups are lumped together.
Latinos headline the immigration debate because they make up the bulk of the immigrants in the United States -- both legal and illegal.
And it's Latinophobia that is fueling the debate as whites and blacks, nativists and labor unions come together in common cause to turn back the demographic tide.
The Republican Party knows this.
It's been stoking these fears for the last 20 years.
I want to help Republicans own up to their mistakes, although it's hard to feel sorry for them.
They're getting a beating, but you can't say they weren't warned.
The issue is what will happen to Latinos.
They will remain politically impotent as long as it is impossible for Republicans to win their support and nearly impossible for Democrats to lose it.
While some Republicans are ready to support immigration reform as a peace offering to Latinos, others are still in denial about their misbehavior.
Since memories are short, here are highlights of the GOP's ongoing tantrum against immigrants and Latinos.
-- In 1994, Republicans in California, led by Gov.
Pete Wilson, proposed and pushed Proposition 187, a ballot initiative that sought to deny education and other services to illegal immigrants and their children.
After a campaign filled with racially tinged rhetoric, voters approved the measure, which a federal judge later struck down as unconstitutional.
