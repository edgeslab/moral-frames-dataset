Crist becomes a Democrat
Former Florida Gov.
Charlie Crist is now a Democrat after more than two years as an independent, having left the Republican Party during his 2010 Senate run.
The conversion to the Democratic Party was widely expected as Crist has become increasingly cozy with Democrats, including appearing with President Barack Obama in his re-election campaign.
Most anticipate Crist will seek the Democratic nomination to challenge Florida Gov.
Rick Scott in 2014.

They were first in line on Thursday in their home counties to receive their licenses with their partners.
