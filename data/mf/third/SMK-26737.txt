Doctor chose specialty because he saw a need
Sunday Conversation with ...
Dr. Fadlo R. Khuri
As a young medical student, Dr. Fadlo R. Khuri planned on becoming a psychiatrist.
Then, on the first day of his surgery rotation, he treated a much-loved rabbi with cancer who died within weeks after being admitted to the hospital.
"I just saw the devastation that cancer caused and the immediacy of the disease," Khuri said.
He has treated some 10,000 patients since then, most with tobacco-related cancers.
Earlier this month, the American Association for Cancer Research also honored the 49-year-old oncologist as the 2013 most outstanding young clinical cancer researcher.
In addition to seeing patients, Khuri serves as deputy director of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University and holds the Roberto C. Goizueta chair in translational cancer research at the university's medical school.
Like that rabbi, Khuri is known for his compassion and generosity of spirit.
Q: Can you talk about your work in the prevention of lung, head and neck cancers?
A: The prevention work involves large trials that have used natural compounds such as vitamin A, selenium and others.
We learned that patients who quit smoking and took certain natural compounds did meaningfully better than patients who took the supplements but didn't quit smoking.
Q: What about in the treatment area?
A: We helped develop viruses that we injected into tumors that, when combined with chemotherapy, did a pretty good job controlling the growth of metastatic disease.
Unfortunately, we couldn't get the viruses to all of the places where the cancer was.
Now, we are developing newer viruses that can be given to patients intravenously.
We are helping lead some of these trials.
