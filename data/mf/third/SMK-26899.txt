Citywise: Fremont toughens smoking restrictions
The City Council has toughened Fremont's smoking restrictions, voting to ban smoking in outdoor areas within 25 feet of building entrances and windows.
Other changes to the city's smoking ordinance include banning tobacco-product vending machines and redefining a retail tobacco store as a business in which 75 percent of the gross sales receipts are from the sale of tobacco or smoking products.
The new ordinance also requires landlords of multiunit rental homes to disclose smoking areas and smoking complaint policies to prospective tenants.
In addition, it declares secondhand smoke a nuisance and allows a tenant or property owner to bring a civil nuisance action without having to prove damages.

Nominations filed for Oakland police post
As expected, the city and opposing attorneys filed separate slates of candidates Friday to fill a court-appointed position that will hold significant power over Oakland's police force.
The nominations were filed under seal with U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson, who will ultimately select a compliance director for Oakland's police department.
The director will have authority to spend city funds and overrule top commanders in order to get police fully compliant with a court-sanctioned reform effort agreed to in the wake of the decade-old Riders police brutality scandal.
Henderson can choose one of the candidates proposed, select someone else or order both sides to once again try to agree on a consensus pick.
Neither side would say Friday how many candidates it recommended.
