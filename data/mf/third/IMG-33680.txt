A Closer Look at Some of the More Hotly Disputed Assertions
At the second presidential debate, everyone played fact-checker.
President Obama said, ''Not true, Governor Romney'' to dismiss his rival's charge that oil and gas production permits and licenses on federal lands and waters had been cut in half over the past four years.
(They have declined, but not by half).
Mitt Romney said at one point, ''Let me go back and speak to the points that the president made, and let's get them correct'' after Mr. Obama falsely charged that he had called the strict Arizona immigration law ''a model for the nation.''
(Mr. Romney has spoken favorably of the state's immigration law, but the ''model'' Arizona law he talked about was the mandatory use of a federal electronic verification system to check the immigration status of new hires.)
And the moderator, Candy Crowley of CNN, got into the act, too, when Mr. Romney challenged Mr. Obama's assertion that he had gone into the Rose Garden the day after the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and called it an act of terror.
''You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror?''
Mr. Romney said disbelievingly.
He later added: ''I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.''
