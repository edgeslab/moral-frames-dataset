Supreme Court will hear 2 cases related to same-sex marriage
The Supreme Court announced Friday it will consider whether California's ban on same-sex marriage is constitutional and whether Congress may withhold federal benefits from legally married same-sex couples by defining marriage as only between a man and a woman.
The court will hear arguments in the spring, with a decision by June.
The court will examine a key section of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act.
The Obama administration announced in 2011 that it was abandoning defense of the law, and a string of lower courts has said it is unconstitutional to deny federal benefits to same-sex couples who are legally married in the states where they live while offering them to opposite-sex married couples.
This marks the first time the justices will hear arguments relating to same-sex marriage.
Because the DOMA case concerns couples who already are married under state law, it would not require an answer to the broader constitutional question of whether gays must be allowed to marry.
The court also said it would review a lower court's decision to overturn Proposition 8, in which California voters in 2008 amended the state's constitution to ban same-sex marriage.
That case offers a more direct path to deciding whether the constitutional right to marry may be limited based on sexual orientation.
But because of the way the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit decided the case, such a finding is not required.
