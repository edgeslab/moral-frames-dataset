Treatments to kick the smoking habit found effective: review
Popular smoking cessation treatments -- such as nicotine replacements and antidepressants -- improve people's chances of kicking the habit without much risk, according to a review of past research.
"It seems very clear that medications can help.
They're not the magic bullet but you do improve your chances of quitting -- generally -- if you try them.
And as far as we can tell, they're safe to use," said Kate Cahill, who led the study.
Several reviews have looked at the effectiveness of smoking cessation treatments, but the researchers wanted to put those results into a single large review to help people who want to use medical treatments to stop smoking, Cahill, a senior researcher for theCochrane Tobacco Addiction Group at the University of Oxford, UK, told Reuters Health.
About one fifth of the U.S. and UK populations are current smokers, according to the researchers.
Previous studies have found between 70 percent and 75 percent want to quit, but only about 3 percent accomplish that every year.
For the new study, the researchers pulled data from 12 reviews published by theCochrane Collaboration , an international research organization that evaluates medical evidence.
Those analyses, which were conducted between 2008 and 2012, included data from 267 studies of more than 101,000 smokers.
The studies typically compared smokers trying to quit without the help of a smoking cessation treatment to smokers using nicotine replacement therapies, such as nicotine gum and patches, or prescription drugs.
