Give green light to park smoking ban
Vacationers looking to dip their toes in the water at state parks in Pennsylvania should welcome a pilot project that bans smoking at park beaches.
The state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources says the move is primarily aimed at reducing cigarette litter and the expense required to have park employees pick up after smokers day after day.
But limits on smoking also will create a healthier climate for nonsmoking park patrons, while giving smokers one more nudge to kick the habit.
The department hasn't named the parks with lakes where the pilot program could be tried, and the time line for implementing the ban remains open-ended at this point.
Pennsylvania, though, already trails some neighboring states that are either considering or already using smoking bans at their parks to attract visitors who value an open-air experience that doesn't involve inhaling dangerous smoke fumes.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg banned smoking in all city parks more than a year ago.
Camden County recently followed suit by prohibiting smoking across its park system, with a special emphasis on shielding children from secondhand smoke.
Given Gov.
Corbett's tight rein on state spending, a strategy that reduces park litter and maintenance costs makes sense.
Discouraging smoking amid the splendor of the state parks benefits both out-of-state visitors and the many Pennsylvanians who in these poor economic times are vacationing close to home.
