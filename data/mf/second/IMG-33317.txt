Justices throw out parts of Arizona's immigration law
The Supreme Court on Monday struck down several key parts of Arizona's tough law on illegal immigrants, but it left standing a controversial provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people they detain and suspect to be in the country illegally.
The5 to 3 decisionupholding the "show me your papers" provision came with a warning that the courts would be watching its implementation.
Arizona Gov.
Jan Brewer (R) declared victory and said police could enforce the law without resorting to profiling based on ethnicity.
But the ruling, which reinforced the federal government's primacy in immigration policy, also vindicated the Obama administration's decision to challenge the Arizona law almost from the moment it was passed.
The justices will rule Thursday on the http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-obama-supreme-court-health-care-immig ration-rulings-to-close-a-tough-term/2012/06/24/gJQAhWWH0V_story.htmlconstitutio nality of President Obama's most important priority before the court: the health-care law, his signature domestic achievement.
It will be the final day of a term that has been dominated by questions about the power of the federal government.
The immigration decision comes as the issue has taken a central spot in the nation's political conversation and domestic agenda, even as the numbers of illegal immigrants coming to this country have fallen.
It is likely to be just one in a series of court decisions about the role states may play in combating illegal immigration; five states have adopted laws similar to Arizona's, and others are waiting in the wings.
