Support for Gay Marriage Growing, but U.S. Remains Divided
Supreme Court justices tend to say they are not influenced by public opinion.
But they do sometimes take account of state-by-state trends, and the latest developments will not escape their notice as they take up two cases related to same-sex marriage.
Support for same-sex marriage among the public has been growing, but the country remains divided.
In a Pew poll conducted in October, 49 percent of respondents said they favored allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally and 40 percent were opposed.
Four years earlier, in August 2008, the numbers were just about reversed: 39 percent in favor and 52 percent opposed.
A strong majority of younger Americans now support same-sex marriage.
In a Gallup Poll conducted last month, 73 percent of people between 18 and 29 years old said they favored it, while only 39 percent of people older than 65 did.
Respondents appear increasingly inclined to say they are personally opposed to same-sex marriage, rather than say it should be illegal.
The New York Times and CBS News have asked a three-part question over the years that has seen an increase in support for gay marriage.
In November 2004, 21 percent of respondents said gay couples should be allowed to legally marry, while 32 percent favored civil unions and 44 percent said there should be no legal recognition of gay couples' relationships.
In May, 38 percent supported legal marriage, only 24 percent still favored civil unions and 33 percent still said there should be no legal recognition of same-sex couples.
