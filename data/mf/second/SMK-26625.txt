Tragedy spurs effort to snuff out smoking
After her aunt died of cancer, Bettye Muwwakkil decided to help others fight the disease.
"I  want to prevent people from going through all of the tests, the agony, the pain, the suffering that cancer brings, especially lung [cancer], because it literally takes your breath away."
In 2007, she founded the Access to Wholistic and Productive Living Institute to provide smoking cessation training and support, as well as other health services for black residents and other minorities in Prince George's and Baltimore counties.
Muwwakkil, of Greenbelt, said her aunt Avon Legette died years ago from lung cancer at the age of 38 after having smoked since her teens.
Muwwakkil attributed her aunt's death to the smoking.
Legette tried to quit, Muwwakkil said, "but it was so hard.
It's a terrible addiction."
Muwwakkil, 63, used to work as a medical stenographer and remembers also being affected by seeing sick patients.
"Addiction takes a toll on mind, body and spirit," Muwwakkil said.
"Working in a hospital setting, I would see people on oxygen going outside to smoke.
I wanted to do something about it."
Muwwakkil said minorities, particularly African Americans, are more likely to die from cancer than white people.
She referred to a 2012 report by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene that found that black death rates from cancer were higher than for whites.
"We African Americans have the worst impact of cancer," Muwwakkil said.
