Ruben Navarrette: One subject Ryan could help milk
SAN DIEGO -- Got illegal immigrants?
The nation's dairy industry does, and it wouldn't last long without them.
Now that Wisconsin's Paul Ryan has been picked by Mitt Romney for the Republican ticket, let's pour ourselves a glass of milk and have a discussion that we've been none too eager to have.
We need to talk about immigration not as an emotional issue but as an economic one.
Like other dairy states -- i.e., California, New York, Vermont -- Wisconsin depends heavily on the dairy industry.
And the industry depends heavily on illegal immigrant labor.
It's that simple.
The same goes for other outdoor industries such as farming, ranching and landscaping.
If it's a job where you work with your hands and where you work outside, you're going to find a lot of foreign workers doing it.
You can bet that Ryan understands this reality, and that it's one reason he has long supported efforts in Congress to provide a more stable workforce for these kinds of industries.
This includes the AgJobs bill, which was put together by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and would have legalized about 500,000 farm workers.
Ryan was a co-sponsor of every version of that legislation in four consecutive Congresses.
"I believe there was a certain pragmatism at work," Craig J. Regelbrugge, co-chair of the Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform, told me.
"There was a serious constituent issue and economic issue in his district.
The dairy industry in his district produces over $100 million annually in milk and dairy products.
Its `the district's~ nurseries and greenhouses grow almost $45 million in trees, shrubs, and plants."
