In Wash., couples make history
Wedding bliss swept across the state Sunday as hundreds of couples exchanged vows on the day same-sex marriage became legal in Washington.
Emily and Sarah Cofer were  pronounced "legally wed" at 12:04 a.m. by the aptly named Judge Mary Yu at the King County Courthouse here.
Sarah, 31, and Emily, 32, are third-grade teachers in Arlington, north of Seattle.
Nine months ago, their daughter, Carter, was born; Sarah is on maternity leave.
"We never thought we'd be a part of history," Sarah said.
Washington, Maine and Maryland became the first states to pass same-sex marriage by popular vote on Nov. 6, joining six other states -- New York, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont -- and the District of Columbia that had already enacted laws or issued court rulings permitting same-sex marriage.

Chris Gregoire and Secretary of State Sam Reed certified the election results of Referendum 74 on Wednesday, and the law took effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
Because Washington state has a three-day waiting period, Sunday at 12:01 a.m. was the first opportunity for couples to wed.
At Seattle City Hall, about  150 couples were set to be wed Sunday.
Its outdoor plaza was a makeshift celebration point for newlyweds.
As each wedding ended, the couple was escorted to the grand outdoor stairway, strewn with  petals, that leads to the street.
An accordion player serenaded them with the wedding march, an announcer introduced them to a cheering crowd.
