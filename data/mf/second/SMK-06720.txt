U.S. report to criticize cutsto anti-smoking programs
ALBANY, N.Y. - Steve Panetta smoked for 34 years, the last 10 at a three-pack-a-day clip.
He watched his father die from lung cancer and his stepfather struggle with emphysema.
He tried quitting six times before a state-funded cessation program helped him beat the habit in 2002.
On weekends, he is now the guest speaker at anti-smoking programs, exhorting people to quit.
He speaks for free and pulls no punches.
"I rub it right in their face," said Panetta, 55, of Troy, N.Y. "I say, 'If I could make you feel the way I felt back then for five minutes, then wipe it away and let you feel like I feel now for two minutes, you would throw the cigarettes away.
'[#x200a]"
He credits a similar in-your-face attitude in the state's anti-smoking ads and programs for helping him quit.
Now, funding for those often chilling TV ads and other smoking cessation programs in New York and other recession-battered states is being slashed, sometimes more than other government programs, despite success and savings in health-care costs.
A U.S.
Surgeon General report due to be released March 8 will come down hard on states that have cut anti-smoking funds in tough fiscal times, said Terry Pechacek, who oversees the report as director for science in the Office on Smoking and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
