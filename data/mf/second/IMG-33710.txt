Immigration was a major issue in the presidential campaign when Republicans were battling one another for the party's nomination.
It's still an issue, but not one that President Obama or Mitt Romney talks about much, except in front of Hispanic audiences.
During the primaries, Romney tacked to the right on immigration to outflank his conservative rivals.
He went after Texas Gov.
Rick Perry over a long-standing state law that allows illegal immigrants who live in Texas to pay in-state tuition at colleges and universities there.
Romney later attacked former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) for suggesting that illegal immigrants who have lived in the United States for a quarter-century or longer and who have roots in their communities eventually should have an opportunity to gain legal status, although not citizenship.
Romney said he believed in "self-deportation" for the millions of illegal immigrants in the country.
The Hispanic vote will be critically important in the general election, and Romney is fighting an uphill battle.
He has done little during the campaign to move toward the middle on immigration issues.
Rather, he has tried to win Latino votes by talking economics and saying he would promote immigration reform.
Obama has acknowledged that his inability to achieve such reform is his "biggest failure."
