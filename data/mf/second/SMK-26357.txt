George Washington University officials decided to announce the coming of an on-campus smoking ban during the American Cancer Society's Great American Smokeout on Nov. 15.
Before they could do so, dozens of students and staff members were lighting up in protest.
The protesters chain-smoked for hours in a campus plaza Nov. 13.
They say the ban, set to start next school year, will push smokers into unsafe areas or public streets.
Organizers wrote in an open letter that kicking "smokers out of outside - the absurdity here should be noted - destroys the basic freedom of everyone; from the student, to the worker, to the faculty, to the woman walking by, to the man working in a food truck."
Advocates of the ban at GWU are holding strong.
"The CDC and surgeon general say there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke," said Julien Guttman, a GWU public health graduate student who is part of the advocacy group Colonials for Clean Air.
"No matter how much science we have to back up what we are saying, there will always be individuals who see this as a restriction on their freedom."
Colleges and universities have become the latest target of anti-smoking groups.
While schools have long banned smoking indoors, the new bans are addressing outdoor space.
More than 800 schools have banned smoking on campus, according to the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation.
The list is dominated by medical schools and nonresidential community colleges, although more and more residential colleges and universities are joining.
