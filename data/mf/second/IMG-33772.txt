The 'Illegal' Trap
A vigorous discussion is taking place online about the word "illegal" as an adjective for certain immigrants.
An immigrant activist named Jose Antonio Vargas, a former reporter, is urging news organizations like The New York Times to stop using it.
He says the word is inaccurate, improper and demeaning.
The Times's public editor, Margaret Sullivan (an independent voice who writes about The Times but is not part of its news or opinion operations), has been looking into this, interviewing editors and reporters and soliciting readers' opinions.
She says she will weigh in soon.
I figured I should, too, because I have thought about "illegal" a lot (I write immigration editorials).
Five years ago I wrote an Editorial Observer called "What Part of 'Illegal' Don't You Understand?"
explaining why I didn't like the word, but used it anyway.
Not surprisingly, the article didn't settle the debate.
It's still going around, in circles.
Those who agree with Mr. Vargas say "illegal" should be banned because it suggests that "illegal immigrants" are criminals, which often isn't true.
No human being is illegal, they say.
Those who disagree say Mr. Vargas is trying to whitewash the truth.
Words like "undocumented" ignore the fact that the people so described have broken the law.
As so often happens in the immigration debate, these people end up talking past one other.
(Look at the comments on Ms. Sullivan's blog, and the ones that I expect will attach to this post.)
