Will low-nicotine cigarette be a nail in smoking's coffin?
PITTSBURGH - Beverly Anusionwu, a smoker for three decades who favors Maverick menthols, was enticed to the small lab inside the University of Pittsburgh's psychology department by an ad promising free cigarettes and a few bucks for her time.
She spent a couple of hours on a recent morning answering questions about her medical history and undergoing a battery of cognitive tests.
When she finished, researchers handed her five gray packs of cigarettes unlike any she had ever seen, along with instructions to report back daily on how much she was smoking and whether her cravings and moods changed.
"Spectrum menthol," Anusionwu said, reading the label aloud.
"All right, then.
I guess nicotine is nicotine."
Not quite.
The Spectrum cigarettes she'll be smoking for the next six weeks could contain as much as 95 percent less nicotine than her usual brand.
Anusionwu, 54, is among the first of nearly 850 participants around the country who over the next year will help researchers and federal regulators try to answer an important question: How much does nicotine need to be reduced in cigarettes to make them less addictive?
The answer to that question, long explored by academics, has taken on renewed urgency now that the Food and Drug Administration has the authority to regulate the amount of nicotine in cigarettes - although it cannot ban the substance outright.
