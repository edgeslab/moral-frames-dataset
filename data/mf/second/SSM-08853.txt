A TIPPING POINT ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE
For 14 years, same-sex marriage proponents lost every popular vote.
But the 2012 general election may well be remembered as the day that changed all that when three states - Maine, Maryland and Washington - approved ballot measures to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples.
Nine states plus the District of Columbia now recognize marriage for gay and lesbian couples.
This is progress.
It was just over two years ago that a major national poll first found a narrow majority of Americans supported same-sex marriage.
But it wasn't until this election that the shift in attitudes was reflected at the ballot box.
Since 1998, voters have voted 32-0 in state elections to ban same-sex marriage.
This lopsided voting record had been a powerful argument of those fighting against marriage equality.
They claimed that while some courts and legislatures had approved same-sex marriage, when the question was put to voters it was uniformly rejected.
Even the liberal state of California passed Proposition 8 in 2008 limiting marriage to a man and a woman.
Now it appears the tipping point may have been reached.
In addition to voters in three states approving same-sex marriage, Minnesotans voted against a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.
And the first U.S. president in history to declare his support for same-sex marriage while in office - Barack Obama - was decisively re-elected.
