Romney Revises Position on Deporting Young Illegal Immigrants
With hours to go before the presidential candidates meet in Denver for their first debate, Mitt Romney has scaled back his acceptance of a program by President Obama to grant reprieves from deportation to hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants.
On Monday, after months of pressure to clarify whether he would end the program if elected, Mr. Romney said in an interview with The Denver Post that he would not cancel two-year deportation deferrals already granted by the Obama administration.
"I'm not going to take something they've purchased," Mr. Romney said.
But on Wednesday morning, campaign aides clarified that Mr. Romney intended to halt the program after he took office and would not issue any new deferrals.
"We're not going to continue Obama's program," an aide said by e-mail.
"We're going to replace it and would only honor visas already issued."
Mr. Romney has said that instead of Mr. Obama's temporary measure, he would seek a long-term solution for young undocumented immigrants.
He has said he would support legislation to give permanent resident green cards to illegal immigrants who serve in the military.
"He will seek from Day 1 to work as quickly as he can for a permanent solution that will supersede what Barack Obama did," said Alberto Martinez, an adviser to the Romney campaign.
"He will replace certainty and permanence for something that is uncertain and not permanent."
