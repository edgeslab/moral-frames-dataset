'Mexican Mitt' just does not get immigration
Lately, much noise has been coming from the Republicans about how immigration is not that big an issue for Hispanics and how it will not turn Latino voters away from Mitt Romney, their presumptive presidential contender.
The economy, not immigration, is the No.
1 issue for Latinos, they say.
And the economy is Romney's strongest point, they argue.
I have news for them: As poll after poll makes clear, even if it is not at the top of their list of concerns, there is no more defining issue than immigration for the nearly 20 million Latinos who are eligible to vote.
Yes, it is true that, not surprisingly, Hispanics share the concerns of the rest of the population.
But it is also true that a politician's attitude towards immigration is decisive in earning the trust of Latino voters.
Recently, both Latinos and general voters were polled by The Wall Street Journal/NBC/Telemundo.
The research confirmed once again what many of us already knew: Latino voters see immigration as very important.
It also ratified that even if for other voters immigration is not as important, they are far more open to practical solutions than what Romney and Republicans believe.
According to the poll, when Latino voters were asked if they could tell the presidential candidates one thing, "immigration reform" was the second most popular answer, closely behind "fix the economy."
