Oakland Tribune editorial: High Court made correct decision on Arizona's law
Two things were made abundantly clear by Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding Arizona's immigration law.
First, it is time for Congress and the president to get serious about long-term immigration policy.
Second, the responsibility for doing so is firmly in their hands.
The high court's rejection of much of the Arizona law is based on what we believe is the correct notion that immigration policy must be a function of the federal government, not individual states.
The court ruled that even if the federal government has done a poor job of enacting and enforcing immigration policy -- and, in our view, it certainly has -- it still has sole jurisdiction in that arena.
While the ruling may offer temporary comfort to those in the federal government who opposed the Arizona law, that comfort may be short-lived.
The court's decision clearly places responsibility for sane immigration policy in the federal domain.
To us, the notion of a patchwork immigration policy was silly and unworkable.
It simply must be a national policy.
However, that means that Congress and the president must now set about to establish reasonable and rational policy.
Yes, we realize that there is an election in November and that it is unlikely that anything productive will be done before then, but this decision should set up a serious immigration showdown soon after the election regardless of who is elected president and which party controls Congress.
