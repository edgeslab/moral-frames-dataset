The Immigration Debate: A Bush Tells Romney 'It's Never Too Late' to Lead
6:33 p.m.
Updated George P. Bush said on Tuesday that ''it's never too late'' for Mitt Romney to take a leadership role in the immigration debate, but he acknowledged Republicans were outflanked by President Obama's election-year decision to allow hundreds of illegal immigrants to remain in the country without fear of deportation.
''Governor Romney had an opportunity to get in front of the president on the issue,'' said Mr. Bush, 36, the son of former Gov.
Jeb Bush of Florida.
''But the president clearly has taken the initiative on it.''
Mr. Bush, who is urging younger voters to increase their participation in the 2012 election through his political action committee called MavPAC, said he hoped Mr. Romney would still ''formulate a plan - a more comprehensive plan'' on immigration.
But he added, ''Leading up to Election Day, it's very difficult to get anything so controversial through, so we'll see.''
The White House announced a policy last month that would clear the way for young illegal immigrants to come out of the shadows, work legally and obtain driver's licenses and many other documents they have lacked.
The temporary reprieve could benefit at least 800,000 young people.
The decision fell short of Mr. Obama's pledge to pursue a broad overhaul of the nation's immigration laws during his first term.
Yet Republicans concede the move is likely to help the president's appeal to Hispanic voters who could play an influential role in the presidential race.
