Obama Likes Some Sin Taxes More Than Others
President Obama's budget continues the Democratic preference for cigarette taxes over alcohol or soda taxes - even though alcohol and soda consumption may cost society more money than smoking.
In his budget, Mr. Obama calls for almost doubling the federal cigarette tax, to $1.95 per pack, up 94 cents from the current level.
The tax increase would raise about $8 billion a year over the next decade and help pay for early childhood education.
Higher taxes on cigarettes reduce smoking rates, multiple studies have found.
Lower smoking rates, of course, bring large benefits for society, by reducing early death and making people healthier.
We'll leave to others the debate over whether tobacco taxes today are too low, too high or just right.
But the Obama budget helps highlight how politically popular tobacco taxes are even though they may pack less of a fiscal punch than other sin taxes.
Why?
Smokers tend to inflict damage mostly on themselves.
The rise of no-smoking workplaces and restaurants means that secondhand smoke does less damage than it once did.
And smokers die early, reducing their long-term use of Social Security, Medicare and other federal benefits.
Soda and alcohol are both a bit different.
From some earlier reporting I did on alcohol:
Right now, the patchwork of alcohol taxes isn't coming close to covering those costs - the costs of drunken-driving checkpoints, of hospital bills for alcohol-related accidents and child abuse, and of the economic loss caused by death and injury.
[In 2006] some 17,000 Americans, or almost 50 a day, died in alcohol-related car accidents.
An additional 65,000 people a year die from other accidents, assaults or illnesses in which alcohol plays a major role.
