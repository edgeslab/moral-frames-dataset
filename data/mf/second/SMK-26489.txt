Graphic ads worked, CDC says; Many called in, sought tips to quit smoking
The federal government says its graphic ad campaign showing diseased smokers has been such a success that it is planning another round next year to nudge more Americans to kick the habit.
The ads, which ran for 12 weeks in spring and early summer,  aimed to get 500,000 people to try to quit  and 50,000 to kick the habit long-term.
"The initial results suggest the impact will be even greater than that," says Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which spearheaded the $54 million  campaign.
The ads showed real Americans talking about how smoking caused their paralysis, lung removal and  amputations.
He says it's the first time the U.S. government has paid for anti-smoking ads, although some media  ran them  free.
The CDC doesn't have a tally yet on how many people actually tried to quit,  but it says the ads generated 192,000 extra calls -- more than double the usual volume -- to its national toll-free quit line, 800-QUIT-NOW, and 417,000 new visitors  to smokefree.gov, its website offering cessation tips.
That's triple the site's previous traffic.
"We do plan to do another (campaign) next year," Frieden says, adding that he has no details yet on the ads or their timing.
He says the amount the CDC spent this year is a pittance compared with the $10 billion the tobacco industry spends annually to market its products.
