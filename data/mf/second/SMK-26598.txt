Tax increase prods smokers to quit
Groups that try to help smokers kick the habit say they've seen more demand for their services since the state raised the tobacco tax this summer.
The new tax took effect July 1, and during the first two weeks of the month, QuitPlan Services received 900 calls through a helpline -- an increase of 256 percent compared with the same period last year.
The free stop-smoking program, operated by ClearWay Minnesota, has seen a similar increase in website traffic, according to a news release issued Wednesday.
Similarly, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota says that during the first two weeks of July, 186 people enrolled in the Eagan-based health insurer's quit-smoking program.
That's a jump from 69 people during the first two weeks of July 2012.
Earlier this year, the Legislature increased the state cigarette tax by $1.60 per pack to $2.83, now sixth-highest in the nation.
The law also raised the tax on cigars and chewing tobacco.
The tax hike is projected to raise $430 million over the next two years.
Gov.
Mark Dayton and other proponents said the goal was not to generate revenue but to discourage Minnesotans, especially young people, from smoking.
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids estimates the tax increase will save Minnesota $1.65 billion in long-term health care costs associated with smoking and lead to more than 25,700 fewer smoke-related deaths.
