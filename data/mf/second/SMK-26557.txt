AU widens smoking ban to outdoors
American University's ban on smoking went into effect Thursday throughout its Northwest Washington campus except for three outdoor spots, where smokers will be able to light up a few more months to help them through the transition.
At least two other local schools have implemented smoking bans this summer: the University of Maryland at College Park and George Washington University.
Nationwide, the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation estimates that nearly 1,200 college and university campuses have gone smoke-free.
Montgomery College and Towson University were among the leaders of the movement in Maryland.
For many years, AU had banned smoking indoors and within 25 feet of building entrances.
But university officials, prodded by student leaders who oppose smoking, decided last year that those limits were not enough.
Now the ban will cover outdoor areas as well.
Three small spots on campus have been set aside for smokers, but just through Dec. 23, when those havens will disappear, too, and smokers will be forced to leave campus to have a cigarette or cigar.
In practical terms, that may push many smokers onto the public sidewalks along Massachusetts and Nebraska avenues.
The campus ban also covers the use of chewing tobacco.
A quick look at the outdoor smoking spots Thursday morning found them nearly deserted.
One employee who put out his cigarette and deposited the butt into a "smoker's pole" declined to be interviewed because he was concerned about his job.
