Prince's "Rally 4 Peace" concert Sunday in Baltimore will be aired live, for free, on Jay Z's new streaming service, Tidal.
The usually apolitical Purple One announced he was staging the show in response to the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray.
He also wrote a new song called "Baltimore" that he will presumably perform Sunday night.
A portion of all proceeds benefit Baltimore youth charities.
Concertgoers are invited to wear something gray as a sign of solidarity.
"I am honored to join Prince in his mission to inspire through the uniting power of music and be able to offer a platform where this moment can be shared globally," Jay Z said in a news release.
"We invite all to experience the music and contribute in their own way to promote peace, tolerance and understanding.
Our prayers go out to Freddie Gray's family and every family affected by brutality and senseless violence."
The concert will stream via tidal.com beginning at 7 p.m.
Tidal plans to match any donations made through the site, with proceeds going to the Baltimore Justice Fund.
