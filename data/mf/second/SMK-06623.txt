Madigan expects cigarette tax battle
SPRINGFIELD, ILL. - Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan said Wednesday he supports a cigarette tax increase to shore up Medicaid but expects Republicans will block the idea.
Quinn wants to raise cigarette taxes by $1 a pack - up from 98 cents - to bring in about $670 million.
It would be coupled with cuts in Medicaid services and rates to close a $2.7 billion shortfall in the health care program for the poor.
"I would support an increase in the cigarette tax, especially for the Medicaid program," Madigan said.
"The Republican position to date is against, so I don't think it will pass."
The Chicago Democrat also called Gov.
Pat Quinn's plan to cut pension costs "a good start" that will face strong opposition.
That plan includes raising the retirement age and requiring workers to contribute more.
