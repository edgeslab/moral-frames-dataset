DMV position on driver's licenses for young illegal immigrants
California's Department of Motor Vehicles has clarified its policy on issuing driver licenses to young illegal immigrants who may be able to obtain work permits under a new federal deportation relief program.
The agency last week said it would grant licenses but backtracked on Monday and finally in the afternoon said legislation or a new regulation might be needed to grant the licenses.
Here is the DMV statement:
"Following is an updated statement regarding the impact (of) the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as it pertains to the issue of Driver Licenses and ID Cards in California:
"As the DMV initially stated, it appears that young people who receive federal deferrals will be eligible for California driver's licenses, but it remains uncertain whether clarifying legislation or regulations will be necessary.
This is because under current state regulations, only certain types of federal immigration documents support the issuance of a California driver's license.
Further state legislative or regulatory clarification may be needed if the federal government's new deferral program results in the issuance of new or different immigration documents."
