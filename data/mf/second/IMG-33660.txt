ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION; Happy ending not in script
Tony Guerrero is celebrating a milestone in his acting career here and saying goodbye at the same time.
His success is tied to "Undocumented Executive," a low-budget comedy shot in the Atlanta area.
Guerrero plays the main character, a naive illegal immigrant from Mexico who achieves his American dream of landing a top corporate job.
It is the veteran actor's first lead role in a feature-length comedy film.
Like his character, Guerrero is an illegal immigrant from Mexico.
But things are more complicated in real life: There is no happy ending in sight for the Dunwoody actor.
He must leave the country by Jan. 24 or face deportation.
So a screening of the film Saturday night at the Plaza Theatre was also meant to serve as a going away party.
Guerrero, 39, knows he got himself into this predicament through his own actions.
He violated the nation's immigration laws and pleaded guilty to a simple battery charge here in 1999.
At the same time, he can't help wondering what could have been.
"Undocumented Executive" could move him one step closer to achieving his American dream of getting noticed, starring in a Hollywood blockbuster and earning an Oscar.
Meanwhile, it likely represents the end of his acting career here.
He is also set to leave behind his family as well as an acting and modeling school he operates with his wife in Atlanta.
