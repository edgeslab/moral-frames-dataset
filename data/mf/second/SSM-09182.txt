Colorado Democrats Elect State's First Gay Speaker
DENVER -- Democratic lawmakers in Colorado sustained a wrenching defeat in the final days of the legislative session last spring.
A bill that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples was blocked from getting a full vote in the State House of Representatives by Republican leaders, who knew Democrats had the votes to pass it.
But this week, Democrats here regained control of the House, buttressed by a favorably redrawn legislative map and simmering anger over the civil unions debate.
And on Thursday, punctuating the moment, Democratic lawmakers elected the state's first openly gay speaker of the House.
The new speaker, State Representative Mark Ferrandino, a Democrat from Denver, was a co-sponsor of the civil unions bill and has vowed to bring it back when the session resumes in January.
''Twenty years ago, Amendment 2 passed in Colorado,'' an emotional Mr. Ferrandino said after his election, referring to a 1992 state constitutional amendment passed by voters that banned laws protecting gay men and lesbians from discrimination.
''And now we have our first openly gay speaker.
I think that is an amazing turnaround for our state.
It speaks volumes for how much we've grown.''
Amendment 2, which led some to call Colorado ''the hate state,'' was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court.
A separate 2006 amendment to the state Constitution defined marriage as being only between a man and a woman.
