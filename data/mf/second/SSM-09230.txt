Vikings' Chris Kluwe on defeated marriage amendment: 'It's great'
Vikings punter turned pundit Chris Kluwe lauds Minnesota voters for defeating a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman.
Taking advantage of his stature as an NFL player, Kluwe championed gay rights and condemned an Election Day ballot initiative that hoped to fight back the movement to one day legalize same-sex marriage.
"It's great that Minnesota defeated this amendment process and said to everyone, 'We're not going to have discrimination in the state constitution.'
I think it's great," Kluwe said Wednesday, Nov. 7.
Kluwe began receiving national attention with his scathing letter in September to Emmett C. Burns, a Maryland state legislator who wanted the Baltimore Ravens to silence a player for advocating legalization of same-sex marriage in that state.
Kluwe regularly tweeted on gay marriage.
He wrote multiple entries about gay marriage in his Pioneer Press blog before quitting over the paper's editorial on the marriage amendment.
He made public appearances in opposition of the amendment and gave numerous local and national interviews on the subject.
"I had no inkling that was going to happen," he said.
"You've all seen me.
I just say what's on my mind, and apparently this time a lot of people listened.
It was kind of weird."
The punter was asked whether he influenced the debate in Minnesota.
"Hopefully, I did.
I mean, I think ultimately it's more a testament to the people of Minnesota, that they realized this was the right thing to do," Kluwe said.
"If I did help out, then I'm glad I was able to make a difference.
I think it ultimately comes down to everyone just worked really hard to try to defeat this thing, and we were successful."
