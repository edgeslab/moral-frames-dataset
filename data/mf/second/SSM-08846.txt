Nearly three weeks after an election in which gay marriage supporters won major victories in several states, the nation's largest gay rightsorganizationis launching a new television ad campaign to seize on the momentum it picked up on Election Day.
Actor Morgan Freeman narrates the new Human Rights Campaign spot, which draws parallels to the civil rights movement and the fight for women's suffrage.
The ad lauds the Nov. 6 victories and says the resultsemboldenedgay rights advocates to press onward across thecountry.
"Withhistoricvictoriesfor marriage, we'vedelivereda mandate for full equality.
The wind is at our back, but our journey has just begun," Freeman says in the commercial.
The ad, which has $250,000 behind it, began airing during news programming in the Washington D.C., Los Angeles and New York City media markets on Sunday and will continue for a week.
The commercial comes during what gay rights advocates see as a crucial moment spurred bysignificantvictories at the polls earlier this month.
Maine, Maryland and Washington voted to legalize gay marriage on Nov. 6, while voters inMinnesotadefeated a gay marriage ban.
Exit polls showed a shift in support amongAfrican Americans and Hispanics.
And on Nov. 30, the Supreme Court is set to sort through a half-dozen cases involving the issue of same-sex relationships, most of which involve the Defense of Marriage Act.
"This year proved to be a pivotal turning point in the movement for marriage equality and now we press onward with renewed vigor and public opinion squarely on our side," said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin in a statement.
