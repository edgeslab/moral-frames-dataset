Charles Krauthammer: The way forward for Republicans
They lose and immediately the chorus begins.
Republicans must change or die.
A rump party of white America, it must adapt to evolving demographics or forever be the minority.
The only part of this that is even partially true regards Hispanics.
They should be a natural Republican constituency: striving immigrant community, religious, Catholic, family-oriented and socially conservative.
The principal reason they go Democratic is the issue of illegal immigrants.
In securing the Republican nomination, Mitt Romney made the strategic error of (unnecessarily) going to the right of Rick Perry.
Romney could never successfully tack back.
For the party in general, however, the problem is hardly structural.
It requires but a single policy change: Border fence plus amnesty.
Yes, amnesty in return for full border enforcement.
I've always been of the "enforcement first" school, with the subsequent promise of legalization.
I still think it's the better policy.
But many Hispanics fear that there will be nothing beyond enforcement.
So, promise amnesty right up front.
Secure the border with guaranteed legalization to follow on the day the four border-state governors affirm that illegal immigration has slowed to a trickle.
Imagine Marco Rubio advancing such a policy on the road to 2016.
It would transform the landscape.
He'd win the Hispanic vote.
Yes, win it.
A problem fixable with a single policy initiative is not structural.
It is solvable.
