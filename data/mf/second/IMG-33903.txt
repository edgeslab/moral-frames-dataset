ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO NOW AT NET ZERO
The statement
"If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero.
It's been that way now for almost two years."
Jeb Bush, former Florida governor, in an interview on Meet the Press

The ruling: TRUE
As millions watch them during their national convention in Tampa, Republicans are trying to appear tough on illegal immigration without offending Hispanic voters.
Former Florida Gov.
Jeb Bush, who is bilingual and met his wife in Mexico, has warned fellow Republicans they need to watch their tone on the immigration issue.
He repeated the warning in an interview on Meet the Press the weekend before the convention.
"My personal view is that we need to get beyond where we are," Bush said.
"We need to create a climate of border control.
And that's begun to happen, if you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it's net zero.
It's been that way now for almost two years.
And if you say, 'Well, we've gotten a much better grasp on the number of people just coming in without papers,' then you could develop a strategy that's part of economic growth.
..."
For this fact-check, we will research whether Bush was correct when he said the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country is net zero, and that it's been that way for two years.
