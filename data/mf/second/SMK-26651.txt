PUFF SNUFF Marlboro maker saddles up for ... e-cigs!
THE MARLBORO Man's rugged image could soon go up in smoke.
Altria Group, the nation's No.
1 tobacco company and owner of Marlboro maker Philip Morris USA, on Tuesday became the latest major player to enter the fledgling but potentially lucrative electronic cigarette business.
The Richmond, Va.-base company unveiled its new MarkTen e-cigarette brand at its annual investors day conference in New York City.
Altria said it will begin distributing MarkTen in August through its Nu Mark subsidiary, which also sells Verve chewable nicotine discs.
MarkTen will initially only be sold in Indiana, though.
Altria didn't announce when or if it would roll out the brand nationally.
"The (electronic cigarette) category is in its early stages and time will tell how it will evolve," Altria CEO Marty Barrington told investors.
While it's the biggest tobacco company, Altria - whose dozens of products include Parliament, Virginia Slims and Skoal - was late in jumping into what's become a billion-dollar industry.
Sales have been growing every year since e-cigarettes were introduced in the U.S. around 2007.
RJ Reynolds, the maker of Camel, Kool and Winston, began selling its e-cig, Vuse, last year in limited markets.
Last week Reynolds said it would launch a new version of Vuse in Colorado this summer ahead of a national rollout.
Lorillard, the third-largest U.S. tobacco company and maker of Newport and Kent, last year bought the company that makes BlueCigs.
The brand has been advertised on TV since October in commercials featuring actor Steven Dorff.
