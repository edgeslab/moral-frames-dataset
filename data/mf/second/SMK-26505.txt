GUEST COLUMN; Ban clearing the air in parks benefits health
This week my colleagues and I passed legislation to ban smoking in Atlanta city parks.
I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this legislation, and I applaud the city for taking a much-needed step to improve the health of our residents.
While I have listened to both sides of the smoking debate, I have personally seen the negative impact of smoking on visitors of our parks.
I am a frequent park user.
I have witnessed smoking around children at our splash- pad facilities and playgrounds such as those at Perkerson Park.
I have witnessed smoking at festivals and large gatherings, including the Atlanta Jazz Festival.
I have seen park users ask others to stop smoking, and I have seen them refuse.
This has to stop.
This legislation is not just a matter of policy but of public health.
Secondhand smoke has been proved to contribute to health issues, including asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and cancer in our children and adults.
Cigarette butts and other debris from smoking can cause health issues for our children and our pets.
These facts cannot be ignored, and with the rising costs of health care treatment, this decision comes at exactly the right time.
Atlanta is known for beautiful greenspace and public parks.
We want to preserve this distinction.
Removing smoking from our parks will help complete this vision.
Parks should be a place that residents can go and enjoy free of health concerns.
They should be places that we can go to be reinvigorated.
If we want our residents to continue to take full advantage of our parks and recreational facilities, we must make sure they are clean, safe, landscaped and now, smoke-free.
