COUNTY REGISTRY HAS SUPPORT
St. Petersburg has one.
Clearwater has one.
Even Gulfport, a city of 12,000 people, beat Pinellas County in establishing a domestic partnership registry.
On Thursday, the Pinellas County Commission will meet to discuss allowing unmarried residents to register as domestic partners, giving them rights that, currently, only come with a marriage license.
The registry would be countywide, effectively stitching together the patchwork that exists now that means domestic partners registered in one city are not recognized in all of the others.
"It makes sense for the county to do it countywide instead of having a registry in every little town, but it didn't happen that way," said Commissioner Susan Latvala.
"So we're playing catch-up."
It will be some time before the commission votes on the proposed registry, but a majority of its seven-member board supports the idea.
Gulfport, which has a large gay and lesbian population, was the first city in Pinellas County to create a registry, unanimously approving one in May.
St. Petersburg followed and since Aug. 1, when the city clerk began offering domestic partnerships, 223 couples have registered.
Clearwater also has one.
Tampa was the first city with a registry in the Tampa Bay area, creating one in March.
And across Florida, a handful of counties have passed them, including Miami-Dade, Leon, Orange, Broward and Palm Beach.
Hillsborough County has not approved one.
