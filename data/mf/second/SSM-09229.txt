A landmark choice for marriage equality in Md.
It's pretty rare to cast a ballot that qualifies as genuinely historic.
So I and more than 1 million other Marylanders can take special satisfaction in being among the first in the nation to approve equal marriage rights for gay and lesbian couples by popular referendum.
We mustn't underestimate the importance of this result.
It's become common to think the issue of gay marriage is behind us, because the long-term trend in favor of same-sex nuptials is so clear.
The younger generation doesn't understand why we're still arguing about it.
Gay marriage is already legal in six states and the District.
But success in those states came only because of actions by legislatures or judges.
The victory in Maryland - together with a similar one on the same day in Maine - shows for the first time in America that the public as a whole can side with the principle of equality rather than channel the reflexive, anti-gay prejudice that still lingers in our society.
(Same-sex marriage was also on the ballot in Washington state, where the result wasn't available at deadline for this edition.)
Marriage triumphed in Maryland partly because activists from the start openly stressed the powerful appeal of equal, civil rights, especially to African American voters.
They did so more than earlier campaigns have done in other states.
That approach won over Beverly Clough, 62, of Prince George's County.
She voted for same-sex marriage even though it makes her uncomfortable.
