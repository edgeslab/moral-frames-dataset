Photographer captures immigrants - as superheroes
POORLY PAID Mexican immigrant workers who battle valiantly to feed and clothe and shelter their families in New York City - while also sending cash to loved ones south of the border - are the great unsung "superheroes" of America.
That's the message of a captivating new photo exhibit at Columbia University that pays homage to the strong-willed women and tough-as-steel men who overcome long odds, bad bosses and lousy labor conditions to survive and prosper.
Titled "Superheroes: Latino Immigrants Who Make New York," the show, which opened Thursday at Columbia's Center for the Study of Ethnicity & Race, features ordinary people in their workplaces - clad in the costumes of extraordinary superheroes.
The photos of 38-year-old, Mexico City-born U.S. immigrant Dulce Pinzón portray a laundermat worker dressed as Wonder Woman, a window washer as Spiderman, a cabbie as Batman, a waiter as Mr. Elastic, a deliveryman as Superman, a nanny as Catwoman.
"This is a time of increased demonization and stereotyping of Latino immigrants who are typically excluded from all kinds of heroic narratives," said Frances Negrón-Muntaner, director of the Columbia center and curator of its gallery.
"These works should redefine our idea of what a superhero really is - and show the enormous sacrifices and enormous contributions these workers make to the wellbeing of New York City and America and their home communities."
