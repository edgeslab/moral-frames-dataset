NEW VIEWS ON WEEK'S TOP TALKERS
EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL
A reader  compared same-sex marriage to polygamy and cited the nebulous word "morality" as  a reason for opposing both ("High court praised, panned for taking on gay marriage," Your Say, Tuesday).
However, our nation has a long tradition of valuing the equality of its citizens.
Polygamy was developed in a patriarchal culture where women were seen as the property of men.
It has no place in a society where men and women are equal under the law, and neither does a ban on same-sex marriage.
To say a man can marry a woman but a woman cannot is to treat men and women as  separate classes of citizens and is a form of  discrimination.
When same-sex marriage is legalized, America will finally be on the path to true gender equality.

And in cases where it is, then it should be fully taxable as income.
Many people would be shocked what it costs.

MLB DESERVES CHEATERS
Barry Bonds and  players whose steroid use came out later should be allowed to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame as well as keep any records they achieved.
Same for Lance Armstrong and his Tour de France truimphs.
Don't think  that I condone their actions.
In fact, I'm repelled by them.
