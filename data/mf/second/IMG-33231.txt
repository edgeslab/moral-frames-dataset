It's a blow for HB 87
The Supreme Court's decision in Arizona v. United States is a resounding defeat for state anti-immigration movements, particularly in Georgia.
The court's decision puts an end to state efforts to enforce federal immigration law and create mini-state immigration systems.
As Justice Anthony Kennedy noted in his opinion: "[T]he States are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress, acting within its proper authority, has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance."
Georgia legislators ignored warnings of this last year when considering HB 87 and chose to take the political rather than the legal path.
The pending challenges to the two stayed provisions of HB 87 will now move forward.
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Thrash found two key parts of HB 87, Sections 7 (the harboring, inducing, transporting provision) and Section 8 (the "show-me-your-papers" provision) were preempted, and barred those two provisions from taking effect.
The Court of Appeals will now rule, in light of the Supreme Court's decision, whether these two sections of HB 87 will remain invalidated.
The Supreme Court threw out three provisions of the Arizona law that, if implemented, would have conflicted with the federal plan.
As a result, laws requiring the arrest by state officials of people they "reasonably believed" to be illegal, of those who did not carry proof of immigration status (as if that could be determined with simple documents), and making it a crime to work in Arizona without work authorization (currently not against any federal law), cannot be implemented.
