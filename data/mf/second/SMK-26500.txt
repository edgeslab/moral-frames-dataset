smoker fix
A CHAIN-SMOKING transgender recluse in one of Manhattan's landmarked upper West Side co-ops will have to let repairmen in to fix a gaping chasm in her living room wall, a judge ruled Tuesday.
Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Cynthia Kern issued that order as she refused the co-op's request to order Diane Wells to stop smoking.
Kern acted after hearing Wells' upstairs neighbor Natalie Elsberg testify that secondhand smoke from Wells' ninth-floor apartment at 300 Central Park West has permeated her home night and day since the family moved there in February.
"All the rooms are affected, particularly at night in the children's rooms," said Elsberg, claiming her 22-month-old has a chronic respiratory infection.
"Your Honor, please help us."
Wells was not in court.
She called earlier to say she needed time to get a lawyer.Building manager Diana Budzanoski said the hole in Wells' living room is almost 8 feet high and 3 feet wide.
She said workmen created the gap when the building made emergency repairs to a sewage line.
Building engineers believe her cigarette smoke is spreading through the gap.
Ina Bort, a lawyer for the estate of Wells' late mother, Constance Cheney, said the estate supported the co-op's request to get access to the apartment on the grounds that it's an estate asset that could be lost to Cheney's heirs if repairs are not made.
