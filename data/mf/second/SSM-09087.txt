High court praised, panned for taking on gay marriage
Whether you're for gay marriage or against it, the Supreme Court has to rule on the basis of the Constitution.
There is nothing in the Constitution that says a state cannot define marriage as it sees fit.

With all that is going wrong with this country, do we really need to waste time and money on such foolishness as same-sex marriage?

The Defense of Marriage Act needs to go, but some are comparing it  to Dred Scott.
Please don't compare it  to that.
It's incomparable.
@AlecRider
Same-sex marriage is foolish only if you are straight and do not have to consider what rights and benefits you are denied because of whom you love.
This is a considerable economic issue along with a fairness issue.

I'm split on the Supreme Court  taking up Prop 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act.
While I believe in DOMA repeal, I don't like the idea of courts overturning voters' wishes.

If gay marriage is legal, then for sure polygamy should be legal.
On what basis would  polygamy remain illegal?
Morality?
That was thrown out with gay marriage.
Tradition?
King David had a big harem.

This is a civil rights issue that shouldn't be decided at the state ballot box.
The Supreme Court should hear both cases.
I applaud them for taking this on.
