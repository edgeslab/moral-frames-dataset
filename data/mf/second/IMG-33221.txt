Answers sought in border agents' deaths
The families of two U.S. immigration agents shot more than a year ago in Mexico renewed their demand Friday that the U.S. government explain why the agents were there and how guns purchased in the United States fell into the hands of their attackers.
The parents of slain Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jaime Zapata joined with the sister of agent Victor Avila to press the government on whether an operation similar to one in Arizona that allowed illegally purchased guns to be smuggled into Mexico in the hope of tracking them to higher-ranking criminal figures.
The families spoke in Zapata's home town of Brownsville, Tex., one day after the U.S. House voted to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt for not providing documents for a probe of Operation "Fast and Furious" in Arizona.
In that case, ATF agents lost track of weapons.
Two guns in that operation were found where border agent Brian Terry was slain.
Tom Crowley, a spokesman for the Dallas field division of the ATF said the agency "has always said that this investigation has no connection whatsoever to Fast and Furious."
