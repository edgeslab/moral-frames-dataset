No exceptions to cigar regulation
The March 24 news article "Cigar aficionados smoldering over possible rules" reported that the cigar industry is pushing legislation to exempt "traditional large and premium" cigars from Food and Drug Administration regulation.
Unmentioned was that the legislation would exempt hundreds of millions of cigars from regulation, including machine-made cigars that are mass-produced at a rate of 10 per minute.
It would also prevent the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from taking any action to ban the use of candy flavoring in traditional large and premium cigars.
Youth cigar use is on the rise.
Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that nearly as many high school males smoke cigars (15.7 percent) as cigarettes (17.7 percent).
Among black high school males, cigar use exceeds cigarette use.
Candy-flavored cigars are a big part of this rise.
Just like cigarettes, cigars are bad for anyone's health, causing cancer and respiratory and heart disease, and the FDA must be allowed to require basic protections such as warning labels.
