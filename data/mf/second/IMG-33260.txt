SCOTT RETREATS ON ARIZONA LAW
Rick Scott promised voters in 2010 that he would bring an Arizona-style immigration law to Florida.
The pledge - repeated over and over in television and radio advertisements - helped Scott both win over conservatives who didn't know the first-time candidateand expose his Republican primary opponent Bill McCollum as an immigration flip-flopper.
But with two legislative sessions in the books, Scott hasn't just failed to pass an Arizona law, parts of which were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday.
He has stopped talking about it.
PolitiFact Florida is tracking 57 of Scott's promises on the Scott-O-Meter, including promises to implement Arizona-style legislation and a requirement that Florida businesses use a federal database to make sure their employees are in the country legally.
Both are rated Promise Broken.
"He got the majority of the vote for running on those promises," said Bill Landes, a Lake Wales tea party supporter and chairman of the Florida Minutemen Organization.
"And now for him to do an about-face, it's like a heart-wrenching stab in the back for the citizens who helped elect him."
The Legislature in 2011 attempted but failed to pass a requirement that businesses use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of their workers.
Lawmakers never seriously considered the idea in 2012, and Scott all but said he opposed a statewide requirement recently, saying he didn't want to put Florida businesses at a disadvantage.
