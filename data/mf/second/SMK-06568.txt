Proposition 29 will save young lives
As a pulmonary physician who has spent decades battling the ravages of tobacco addiction, I find it painful to watch the disingenuous advertising campaign Big Tobacco is bankrolling to prevent California from raising the cost of cigarettes.
The proposed $1 tax is comparatively low.
California has fallen to 32nd in the nation in its cigarette tax, charging only 87 cents per pack.
By comparison, New York state charges $4.35 per pack, with an additional $1.50 tacked on in New York City.
The $1 increase in the cost of a pack of cigarettes is estimated to result in 228,700 fewer Californian children and teens becoming addicted to tobacco, and will save Californians more than $5 billion in health care costs.
That the dollars go toward curing cancer is just a bonus.
Proposition 29 is the perfect proposition -- save lives, save children, save dollars, help cure cancer.
