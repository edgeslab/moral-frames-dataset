Eating egg yolks can hasten thickening of arteries nearly as much as smoking Just as you were ready to tuck into a nice three-egg omelet again, comforted by news that eggs are not so bad for you, a study warns that for those over 40, the number of egg yolks eaten per week speeds the thickening of arteries almost as severely as cigarette smoking.
The study, published last week in the journal Atherosclerosis, measured carotid wall thickness - a key indicator of heart disease risk - of 1,231 patients who each detailed many health habits, from smoking to egg yolk consumption.
The study subjects typically had suffered a clot-induced stroke or a "mini-stroke" in which symptoms may disappear quickly but which often presage a more serious stroke.
Smoking tobacco and eating egg yolks increased carotid wall thickness with each stair-step up in cigarette smoking or yolk consumption.
By contrast, for those who did not smoke, or who rarely consumed egg yolks, carotid wall thickness increased after 40, but at a slow-steady rate.
Nutritionists have recently begun to agree with egg purveyors that chicken eggs - cheap and packed with protein - got a bad rap as a source of cholesterol.
Still, the government recommends that to limit heart disease risk, Americans limit their cholesterol intake to no more than 300 mg per day (an egg yolk has just over 200 mg), and eat no more than four whole eggs weekly, including those in other goods.
Those who already have heart disease, diabetes, or high LDL-cholesterol, or who have had a stroke, should limit their cholesterol to less than 200 mg per day.
