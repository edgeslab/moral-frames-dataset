Maine & Maryland voters OK gay nups
MAINE AND MARYLAND Tuesday night became the first states where voters approved gay marriage.
In Maine, voters reversed a 2009 vote that rejected a gay marriage law passed by the state Legislature.
In Maryland, the public threw its support behind a law passed earlier this year allowing gay marriage.
"Today we made history and sent a powerful message that we have truly reached a turning point on marriage equality in this country," said Brian Ellner, a prominent gay marriage activist.
Voters in states across the country had rejected gay marriage referendums 32 times.
Eight states - including New York - now recognize gay marriage.
