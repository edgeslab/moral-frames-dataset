Lay out the welcome mat
A wholehearted good luck to Mayor Bloomberg as he embarks on a fresh push to put immigration-friendly reform on the national agenda.
To thrive, the U.S. must welcome the smartest and hardest-working people from all corners of the globe - while enabling those on our soil, documented and not, to contribute fully.
As New York proves, that's the recipe for dynamism, not the deport-first, build-the-highest-fence strategy so many in Washington are intent on.
Bloomberg is bringing together mayors, as he did with his campaign against illegal guns, and business executives - who know firsthand the critical importance of the United States remaining a talent electromagnet.
His venues for two forums to be held Tuesday augur a challenge to the powers that be.
One is in Chicago, President Obama's hometown; the other is in Boston, headquarters for Mitt Romney.
Good.
Because on this crucial issue, President and presidential hopeful are failing to lead.
Across the nation, immigration has been a boon to innovation, a revitalizer of dying cities and a powerful economic driver.
One-quarter of high-tech startups have at least one immigrant founder.
More than 40% of patents awarded in the U.S. have foreign-born inventors or co-inventors.
Areas with the highest immigration also have higher wages for native-born workers and the fastest economic growth.
There's more.
Immigrants are younger than the general population, able to fill low-end jobs and replenish the coffers of programs that support older Americans.
On average, they pay $1,800 more in taxes than they receive in benefits.
