Hiding the Smokes
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose antismoking policies have cut smoking rates substantially in New York City, now wants to ban open displays of cigarettes or tobacco in stores.
It is hard to know whether hiding the products would really work to discourage smoking.
But the hope is that keeping cigarettes out of sight could help prevent young people from developing this deadly habit.
At least this time, Mr. Bloomberg is taking the proposal to the City Council for a full public hearing, instead of issuing an administrative decree, as he did with the ban on large-size sugary drinks.
Speaker Christine Quinn has said she approves of the concept.
The mayor's bill would require tobacco products to be tucked away in cabinets or under a counter; it would not stop stores from advertising that they have cigarettes for sale.
City health officials say that banning smoking in bars, restaurants, and city parks and beaches has helped cut adult smoking from 21.5 percent in 2002 to 14.8 percent in 2011.
Although the legal age to buy cigarettes in New York is 18, about 8.5 percent of city high school students smoke, roughly the same percentage as five years ago.
If the City Council approves the bill, New York will be the first major city in the nation where cigarettes are kept out of sight in stores.
Other nations like Iceland, Canada and Ireland have prohibited the display of tobacco and had success in reducing smoking rates among young people by curbing impulse purchases.
