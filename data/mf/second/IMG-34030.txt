Obama deportation reprieve expands
About 350,000 more illegal immigrants than previously thought could earn an additional two years in the United States when President Obama's new policy takes effect next week, according to the Migration Policy Institute.
Under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, students age 30 or younger who are enrolled in school on the day they apply will be eligible for a two-year reprieve from deportation if they demonstrate that they came to the United States before their 16th birthday, lived here for the past five years and have not been convicted of certain crimes or pose a national security threat.
Before the new rule was announced last week, the program was to be open to students enrolled in school as of June 15, 2012, or those who have graduated high school or received a high school equivalency or honorably left the armed services, including the Coast Guard.
The program takes effect Aug. 15, when the government will begin accepting applications for deferral.
The application includes a fee of $465, used to fund the program, although exemptions will be provided for minors, homeless youths, those with chronic disabilities and those who fall below 150 percent of the poverty level.
Applicants who are denied deferral will not have the option to appeal.
Those approved will be able to separately apply for work authorization in the United States.
