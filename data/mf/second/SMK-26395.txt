In an era when almost every issue related to our health has been politicized, we sometimes fail to recognize opportunities to improve health in a bipartisan manner.
This is the case for Missouri voters on Tuesday, when we have the opportunity to vote yes on Proposition B.
Proposition B will increase the sales tax from the lowest in the U.S., 17 cents per pack, to 90 cents per pack.
A yes vote on Proposition B can help save lives by the thousands, while reducing health care costs.
Cigarettes are sophisticated nicotine delivery devices, designed to efficiently deliver nicotine into the blood via the lungs, where it is rapidly taken to the brain to produce dependence and then addiction.
Producing addiction to nicotine in the victim so that he will continue to buy the product is the intent of the cigarette design.
Once addicted, in spite of understanding that these nicotine delivery devices increase their risk of suffering and death, cigarette smokers usually continue to smoke unless presented with barriers to smoking, and help with smoking cessation.
Ask anyone who has been addicted to cigarette smoking; it is very difficult to quit.
Cigarette companies, and those who sell cigarettes, know that teenagers are especially vulnerable to pressures to smoke.
If teenagers become addicted to cigarettes, cigarette companies often have customers for life.
Establishing barriers, such as higher cigarette sales taxes, reduce the rates of teen smoking.
High cigarette taxes have been proven to provide initial incentives that push more adults to seek medical care to stop smoking and enroll in smoking cessation programs.
