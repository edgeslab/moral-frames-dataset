TIDE TURNS FOR LEGAL SAME-SEX MARRIAGES
It was a brief encounter, neither planned nor expected.
Just one of those happenstance moments when real life turns a corner and bumps into history.
This one was at a holiday reception at the White House.
Nadine Smith and her wife, Andrea, had recently received the party invitation at their St. Petersburg home, no doubt due to work on behalf of Democratic candidates during the recent election.
The date of the reception was Dec. 7, which happened to be the same day the Supreme Court announced it would be hearing arguments on the legality of same-sex marriages.
This was the backdrop when Nadine turned to Andrea and said the woman standing nearby looked awfully familiar.
Turns out, it was Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.
The Smiths introduced themselves, and mentioned they had been married in Vermont.
And on this day of historic significance for same-sex couples, the most Kagan could possibly offer in response was a slight, inscrutable smile.
"If there was ever a time you wanted to dance at the White House, this was the day,'' Nadine Smith said.
"It was a good opportunity to demonstrate that we are just another part of the fabric of society in this country.''
It has been a little more than a week since the Supreme Court announced its interest in same-sex marriage cases, and the reaction has seemed somewhat muted.
Almost as if both sides fear the argument is heading in the other's direction.
