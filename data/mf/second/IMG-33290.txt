Florida wise not to follow ; Immigration crackdown bad business, bad law.
By knocking down most of Arizona's mean-spirited immigration law, the U.S. Supreme Court made it clear Monday that immigration policy remains almost entirely in the federal government's purview.
The decision heightens the need for a bipartisan push for reform at the national level.
It also serves as a warning to Florida lawmakers who have flirted with their own immigration-enforcement efforts.
In a 5-3 decision, justices ruled that three of the most contentious aspects of Arizona's 2010 immigration crackdown unconstitutionally interfered with existing federal rules, which trump state laws.
Arizona went too far, they said, by making it a state criminal offense to be in the country illegally, by making it a crime to work illegally, and by allowing state police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant.
Under federal law, being in the country illegally is a civil, not a criminal offense, working illegally is not a violation (although hiring illegal workers is), and U.S. immigration agents generally cannot conduct warrantless arrests.
Justices unanimously permitted -- for now -- a provision of the Arizona law that requires police officers in some situations to verify the immigration status of people they detain.
Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy ruled that this provision -- the most widely known and most publicly scorned aspect of the law -- "does not interfere with the federal immigration scheme."
It would be a mistake, however, for Florida to enact a similar provision.
