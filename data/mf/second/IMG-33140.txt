The Bay Area ranks behind only metropolitan New York in recruiting high-skilled workers from abroad, but it's not just Silicon Valley tech giants on the hunt for foreign labor, according to a new report.
Sure, a batch of familiar names -- Google, Apple, Yahoo, Oracle, eBay, Intel -- leads the pack of companies seeking to bring foreign tech workers to the Bay Area on temporary H-1B visas, but thousands of other local employers, big and small, are in the temporary foreign worker game.
"It's not just about the Bay Area, New York, Boston and Seattle.
It's also not just about great-big companies," said Sean Randolph, president of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, a business advocate.
"These (visas) are being used by a lot of startups."
The report released Wednesday by the Brookings Institutionis the first to detail where in the country H-1B workers are sought, confirming conventional wisdom of the South Bay as an H-1B hub but also revealing surprises.
Silicon Valley ranks highest in what Brookings calls "H-1B intensity," with 17 foreign workers sought for every 1,000 people in the workforce.
Next on the H-1B per-capita list is more surprising: Columbus, Ind., home to engine-maker Cummins; Durham, N.C., where universities are the biggest H-1B seekers; and the area surrounding New Jersey's capital, Trenton, led in the foreign worker search by banks, drugmakers, IT outsourcers and the group at Princeton University that runs Graduate Record Examinations.
