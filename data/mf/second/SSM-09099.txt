Cases may test Obama's 'evolution' on same-sex marriage
The Supreme Court gave itself plenty of room to maneuver when it agreed Friday to review the issue of same-sex marriage.
The justices could decide one of the great political and civil rights questions of our time, rule narrowly on the two cases it accepted or even punt, on the grounds that the cases are not properly before them.
But the court may have made it more difficult for President Obama to avoid taking a stand on whether it is unconstitutional to exclude same-sex couples from the fundamental right to marry no matter where they live.
Obama was both elected and reelected with strong support from the gay rights movement.
In May, he became the first president to endorse same-sex marriage, saying he had undergone "an evolution" on the matter.
"At a certain point, I've just concluded that - for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that - I think same-sex couples should be able to get married," Obama said, somewhat hesitantly, to ABC's Robin Roberts.
In literally the next breath, Obama endorsed a go-slow approach, saying he didn't want to "nationalize" the issue.
"What you're seeing is, I think, states working through this issue - in fits and starts, all across the country," Obama continued.
"Different communities are arriving at different conclusions, at different times.

And I continue to believe that this is an issue that is going to be worked out at the local level, because historically, this has not been a federal issue, what's recognized as a marriage."
