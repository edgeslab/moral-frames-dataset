Groups Protest Operation By Immigration Agents
An operation by federal immigration agents in Detroit set off protests from Latino and church groups on Wednesday after the officers stopped two illegal immigrants as they were dropping off their children at school.
Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement followed both immigrants, who are from Mexico, as they left their homes in southwest Detroit on Tuesday morning, officials from the agency said.
Both men had children in their vehicles.
One man, Jorge Hernandez, said he was pulled over by agents in unmarked cars across the street from his 4-year-old daughter's school, the Manuel Reyes Vistas Nuevas Head Start center in southwest Detroit.
Mr. Hernandez was questioned but eventually released.
The other man, Hector Orozco Villa, told immigrant advocates that he had been detained by agents near the elementary school of two of his children, Cesar Chavez Academy, a few blocks from the Head Start center.
Mr. Orozco remains in the custody of the agency, which is known as ICE.
The presence of the agents spread alarm among arriving parents and children in the Latino neighborhood, school officials said.
More than 100 people rallied on Wednesday to protest, according to a report in The Detroit News, saying the immigration agency had broken an earlier promise to avoid arrests near schools and other community gathering points.
''It is very alarming to me to have this happen during the rush hour of people taking their children to school,'' said Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic state representative who attended the rally.
''We are really worried about the impact on these United States citizen children.''
Several of Mr. Hernandez's and Mr. Orozco's children were born in the United States.
