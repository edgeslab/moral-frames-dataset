Federal highway bill forces Fremont 'roll-your-own' cigarette store to close
For Marcelo Cadillo, the American dream lay in bins filled with tobacco leaves.
Customers from as far as San Francisco flocked to the tiny roll-your-own store he opened in Fremont's Niles district last year.
There, they could shred tobacco and roll their own cigarettes using small machines -- for about half of the cost of buying traditional brands sold at stores.
But an unlikely foe has sent the dream up in smoke.
A federal highway bill that President Barack Obama signed this month included a provision that imposed boundaries so stern on tobacco shops like Cadillo's that he immediately closed his store.
"It was heartbreaking," said Cadillo, who taped a copy of the bill to his storefront window.
"I felt like I got kicked in the stomach."
The new legislation stretched the definition of tobacco manufacturers to include businesses that use roll-your-own cigarette machines, many of which until then had avoided higher costs and more stringent rules in part by using lower-taxed pipe tobacco, proponents of the law say.
The bill raises taxes and places restrictions on roll-your-own businesses to levels of brand-name manufacturers.
One distributor estimates about 10 roll-your-own businesses were operating in Northern California.
The owners of one, in Vallejo, had begun offering roll-your-own machines four months ago in a former video store.
They closed down July 6, the day the highway bill passed, the (Vallejo) Times-Herald reported.
