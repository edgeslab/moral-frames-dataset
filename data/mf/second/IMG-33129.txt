GUEST COLUMN; Immigration edict delays fix
To be clear, President Barack Obama's decision wasn't just about deportations.
It was also a commitment to grant millions of new work permits.
This presidential edict comes at a time when one in two American college graduates is unemployed or underemployed, and when jobs are at a premium for every American.
Perhaps it was a great idea for a president who is trying to find enough votes to get re-elected in November, but it was a bad idea for a president who is tasked by the U.S. Constitution with enforcing the rule of law.
At its core, America is, and has always been, a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.
These roles are in concert --- not conflict --- with one another.
At least they are until a president tries to create laws by decree rather than through the people's representatives in Congress.
The troubling nature of the president's announcement has as much to do with the constitutional separation of powers and the rule of law as it does with immigration policy.
The tragic consequence of President Obama's overreach is that it delays America even further from finding a permanent solution to our immigration challenges, some of the most morally complex problems of our time.
Residents across the country have different ideas about how to confront illegal immigration.
I believe we must streamline our current immigration laws for temporary workers and permanent residents.
We must eliminate those policies that act as magnets to illegal immigrants, policies that provide jobs, birthright citizenship and access to government-financed benefits.
