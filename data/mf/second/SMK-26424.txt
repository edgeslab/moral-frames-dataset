Poor Smokers Spend 25% Of Income On Cigarettes
ALBANY -- Low-income smokers in New York spend 25 percent of their income on cigarettes, according to a new study, which led advocates for smokers' rights to say it proved high taxes were regressive and ineffective.
The American Cancer Society said that the study, using state data, showed a need to help more poor New Yorkers quit smoking or never start.
The study was conducted by the Public Health and Policy Research program of RTI, a nonprofit institute.
In New York, which has the nation's highest cigarette taxes, a pack of cigarettes can cost $12, though many smokers have turned to buying cheaper cigarettes online or to using roll-your-own devices.
Wealthier smokers -- those earning $60,000 or more -- spend 2 percent on cigarettes, according to the study.
''The poor pay $600 million in cigarette taxes and get little help in quitting,'' Russ Sciandra of the American Cancer Society said.
Mr. Sciandra said state statistics showed that smokers earning less than $30,000 a year paid 39 percent of state and city taxes on cigarettes.
He added that more of the cigarette tax revenue should be used to finance smoking-cessation programs.
Mr. Sciandra said other studies showed that lower-income smokers had less success at quitting.
He said low-income smokers trying to quit were hampered by being around many smokers and having less cash to buy smoking-cessation aids.
