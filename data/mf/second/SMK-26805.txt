Is anti-science sentiment threatening public health policy?
To the Editor:
Thirty-five years ago I was a harried pediatric intern in a New York City emergency room.
One night, I paged a neurosurgeon for an urgent consultation.
He swooped in with a lighted cigarette and leaned over the child to begin his exam.
I politely asked him to extinguish his cigarette; he was dripping ashes on my frightened patient.
Hard to believe, by today's standards.
For almost 20 years, bans on smoking in hospitals have not only protected patients from secondhand smoke, but also inspired hospital employees to quit smoking at higher rates than in other industries.
What's behind this dramatic change?
Science.
Scientific knowledge, relentlessly promulgated through public health campaigns over many decades, alters behavioral norms.
In 1964 Surgeon General Luther L. Terry knocked the Marlboro man off his horse when he announced that smoking causes lung and laryngeal cancer in men.
Thirty-one Surgeon General's Reports on smoking later, cigarette smoking is far from eradicated; yet smokers, who once felt glamorous, are now forced to confront the health hazards of their habit.
Similar claims of progress can be made in other spheres of public health, where robust scientific data have led to strong public policy: highway traffic safety, immunizations, H.I.V./AIDS, sudden infant death syndrome and childhood lead poisoning, to name a few.
But a disturbing trend threatens future public health initiatives.
At the heart of successful public policy lies a shared, bipartisan assumption that science is trustworthy.
Lately, politicians unashamedly issue proclamations tantamount to declaring, The world is flat.
Climate change is a hoax.
Vaccines cause autism.
Intelligent design should be taught in biology class alongside evolution.
The United States has the best health outcomes in the world.
