Immigrants welcome relief from deportation
Grecia Neves of San Jose was scanning the morning news online while chatting on the phone with her husband.
Suddenly an item leapt out at her: President Barack Obama was changing federal policy -- a change that would protect her from deportation, a fear she's had since she was 12 years old.
"I was so emotional," she said.
"My voice was almost gone from crying and screaming."
On June 15, the president announced a new policy to protect undocumented students from deportation and grant two-year renewable work permits.
Across the country, his executive order spawned sighs of relief and shouts of joy from the nearly 800,000 young people like Neves.
Neves, 23, who asked her real name not be used to protect her family, came to the country when she was 12 from Morelos, Mexico.
She's studying physiology at Evergreen Valley College.
For years, she's lived cautiously in the shadows.
Obama's announcement follows the California Dream Act, signed by Gov.
Jerry Brown on Oct. 8, which allows undocumented students to receive private financial aid for higher education and state Cal Grants
"There is a lot of optimism in the community.
People are very hopeful," said Jazmin Segura, the federal policy advocate at Siren, a San Jose immigration advocacy group.
Juan, 17, an incoming freshman at San Jose State University whose name has been changed for his protection, welcomed the new laws.
Like many other undocumented students, he came to the U.S. as a child.
He was brought from his native state, Michoacan, Mexico, by his mother when he was only a few months old.
