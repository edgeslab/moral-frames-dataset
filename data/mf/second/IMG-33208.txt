BORDERLINE DISTORTIONS
Given the debate recently, it might surprise you to know that illegal immigration from Mexico is actually down.
A report from the Pew Hispanic Center, a respected nonpartisan research group, found that migration from Mexico has come to a virtual standstill, and the number of illegal immigrants in the United States may even be in decline.
But you wouldn't know that from the overheated debate, which makes it sound as if immigrants are coming in droves, committing kidnappings and then freeloading on food stamps.
When it comes to issues like Arizona's strict enforcement law, President Barack Obama's Dream Act order, or arguments about border security, there are plenty of distortions, large and small, that enter the political discourse.
PolitiFact, the fact-checking website of the Tampa Bay Times, has long been tracking and debunking inaccurate statements about immigration.
We've found that immigration claims are especially prone to exaggerations and falsehoods.
For example, 29 percent of all claims we check earn a False or Pants on Fire.
But for immigration, 35 percent do.
With that in mind, let's find the border between truth and fiction.
Decapitated bodies in Arizona?
On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled key portions of an Arizona immigration law that was considered one of the nation's strictest.
The court struck down provisions making it a crime for illegal immigrants to seek work and for local officials to jail illegal immigrants for acts that could lead to deportation.
