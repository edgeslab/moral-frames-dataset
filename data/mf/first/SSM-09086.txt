UPHOLD MARRIAGE EQUALITY
By agreeing to hear two cases that challenge legal limits on same-sex marriage, the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to decide whether gays and lesbians are entitled to fair treatment under the law.
The issue is a timely one.
A majority or near majority of Americans, depending on the poll, now say they support making it legal for same-sex couples to marry.
Shifting attitudes are moving in one direction, toward broader acceptance.
Approving marriage equality would affirm a civil right that will soon be a nonissue, much like interracial marriage is today, and put the court on the right side of history.
The cases the high court has agreed to hear challenge the legality of California's Proposition 8, the ban on same-sex marriage passed by the state's voters in 2008, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that denies legally married same-sex couples the right to federal benefits afforded people in heterosexual marriages.
In the California case, the ideologically riven court could turn the clock back on progress by resurrecting the ban passed by Proposition 8.
It could do what fairness demands and recognize marriage equality in the Constitution for gays and lesbians.
Or it could adopt a more narrow rationale articulated by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
That court found Proposition 8 unconstitutional because it imposed a legal disability on a disfavored class of people by repealing the marriage rights for same-sex couples that the California Supreme Court had recognized.
This holding would have an immediate effect only in California.
