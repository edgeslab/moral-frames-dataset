Co-op rule would let owners ban smoking
Greenbelt Homes Inc., a cooperative that owns about 1,600 row houses in historic Greenbelt, is considering a rule that would allow residents to ban smoking in the properties if all of those living in a row of four to five homes are in agreement.
The ban would then be written into their mutual ownership contract, a document that outlines what members can and cannot do to their homes.
After a petition seeking an option to ban smoking, signed by 52 of the more than 1,600 co-op members, was submitted to the GHI board of directors in May, a committee headed by board president Susan Ready was formed to address the issue.
The committee is working with legal advisers to draft a proposal that members could vote on at the annual meeting in May, Ready said.
The issue of smoking in GHI homes came to the fore after a resident brought a lawsuit against the co-op in March 2010, said General Manager Eldon Ralph.
The resident alleged the co-op failed to protect him against the nuisance of his neighbors' cigarette smoke, which he claimed was drifting into his home.
A judge ruled in favor of GHI in November because the resident could not prove damages, but the case led to the petition as residents look for ways to keep smokers and nonsmokers happy in the close quarters of GHI's row houses, Ralph said.
