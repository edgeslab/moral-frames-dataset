ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION; Immigration law push delayed
Atlanta-area police are postponing plans to enforce a hotly debated part of Georgia's immigration law now that the measure is tied up --- once again --- in federal court.
At issue is a statute --- nicknamed the "show-me-your-papers" law --- that would give police the option to investigate the immigration status of suspects they believe have committed state or federal crimes and who cannot provide identification or other information that could help police identify them.
It also would empower police to detain people determined to be in the country illegally and take them to jail.
Police were preparing to start enforcing the law as soon as this week after a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled in favor of it last month.
But under court rules, the measure went back on hold last week when Georgia asked the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider a decision it made against a related state immigration law.
Forsyth and Cherokee county sheriff's deputies are among those now putting off training and other planning to enforce the law.
It doesn't make sense to start drafting a policy for it, Forsyth Sheriff Ted Paxton said, when the legal battle is not over.
"We are simply just in a holding pattern," Paxton said.
"Until [the legal case] is resolved, it is very difficult for us to craft any type of policy because there are a lot of unknowns."
