Maintaining good cardiovascular health boils down to doing seven things (notice I didn't say seven "simple" things): not smoking; being physically active; maintaining normal blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels; staying at a normal weight; and eating a healthful diet.
Alas, a study published March 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that hardly any of us - a paltry 1.2 percent - can check off all seven items, or metrics, on our cardio-health checklist.
And  8.8 percent of us failed to achieve more than one.
Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Emory University and the Harvard School of Public Health analyzed data for 44,959 people age 20 and older from the 1988-1994, 1999-2004 and 2005-2010 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to determine the extent to which participants achieved those seven heart-health goals.
Cardiovascular disease is now the No.
1 cause of mortality in the United States, the study notes, accounting for about 800,000 deaths a year.
The trends that the research detected aren't encouraging: While the percentage of people who were current smokers dropped from about 28 percent to about 23 percent over the study period, the prevalence of people with "desirable" cholesterol levels and blood pressure didn't change much at all.
The other metrics all changed for the worse, with healthful diet, normal BMI and normal blood glucose levels all declining, the study reports.
