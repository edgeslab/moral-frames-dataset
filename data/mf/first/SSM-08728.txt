Maine's gay marriage law goes into effect
PORTLAND, Maine - The first gay and lesbian couples to wed under Maine's new same-sex marriage law exchanged vows early Saturday in a series of spare but joyous ceremonies held shortly after midnight.
"We finally feel equal and happy to be living in Maine," an exuberant Steven Bridges, 42, said shortly after he and his newly wedded husband, Michael Snell, 53, became the first couple at City Hall in Maine's largest town to tie the knot.
After the pair had filled out the necessary paperwork, the city records clerk, Christine Horne, performed the brief, no-frills ceremony, pronouncing the two men married as they exchanged rings and kissed.
Snell's two adult daughters, both from a previous heterosexual marriage, looked on, smiling.
Other couples waiting in the hallway outside the clerk's office cheered the pair as they emerged.
A much larger crowd of about 250 supporters, huddled in front of the building, let out a jubilant roar as Bridges, a retail manager, and Snell, a massage therapist, stepped out into the cold night air.
A group in the crowd sang the Beatles song "All You Need Is Love," accompanied by several musicians playing brass horns.
Many carried signs with such slogans as "America's new day begins in Maine" and "Love one another."
Nearby, a man who identified himself only as a local preacher shouted Bible verses.
"I'm here to speak for the Lord and to warn they need to repent," the man said.
"They should turn from their ways.
Even though man passed a law, doesn't mean God does."
