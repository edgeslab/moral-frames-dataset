Mistrial declared in light-cigarette suit
A St. Louis judge declared a mistrial Tuesday in a $700 million lawsuit against Philip Morris USA, after jurors failed to reach agreement on whether Missouri smokers were misled into believing that light cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes.
The ruling ended a class-action lawsuit that was originally filed in 2000 and that went to trial last month.
Jurors were into their fifth day of deliberations.before the judge declared the mistrial.
Other suits have been filed over the use of phrases such as "light" and "low tar" for cigarette brands.
Philip Morris, which is part of Altria Group, noted that the Federal Trade Commission previously permitted those types of descriptions, which it said were based on results from FTC test methods.
But in June 2010, the Food and Drug Administration began prohibiting cigarette makers from using the descriptionson packaging, advertising and labels.
