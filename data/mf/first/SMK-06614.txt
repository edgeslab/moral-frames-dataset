Science director targets tobacco use
David Ashley
Position: Director of the Office of Science at the Center for Tobacco Products, Food and Drug Administration.
Best known for: The 2009 law giving the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products requires that it base its decisions on science, including proposals to reduce the harm caused to those who smoke and to discourage youngsters from smoking.
Ashley is leading the science agenda, viewing his job as "an incredible opportunity to have an impact on public health."
He has spent the past two years hiring a staff of about 70 people, "getting our feet on the ground," establishing the research agenda, and building relationships with organizations such as the National Institutes of Health that will conduct the scientific inquiries.
Some research priorities include looking at ways to reduce addiction to tobacco products; reducing the toxicity and carcinogenicity of tobacco products and smoke; understanding the adverse health consequences of tobacco use; and understanding communications and marketing about tobacco products.
Government work:Ashley began working at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1983, engaging in scientific research that included chemical terrorism response, the public health effects of heavy metals and the health consequences of tobacco use.
He was named director of the Office of Science at the newly created Center for Tobacco Products in June 2010.
Motivation for service:When Ashley was a teenager, his mother was diagnosed with colon cancer.
She died a few years later.
"I had the desire to do something that would make a big difference in people's lives and their health, even if I couldn't help her.
Working at CDC and FDA has given me that opportunity.
That's what continues to get me to work every morning and keeps me going every day."
