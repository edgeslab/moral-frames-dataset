New Bay Area immigrants moving beyond 'melting pot' vs. 'salad bowl' debate
When she founded the International Institute more than a century ago at a time of increasing anxiety over immigration, social reformer Edith Terry Bremer proposed a novel concept: To be American, you didn't have to forsake everything you left behind.
Bremer has fallen into obscurity, but her philosophy still guides immigrants such as Haile Negussie, who enjoys a comforting support network in the Bay Area's strong Ethiopian community even as he tries to "learn different things" and "meet different people."
His story is common in the Bay Area, where nearly 1 out of every 3 people was born in another country, and where many immigrants have successfully integrated themselves into the region's civic and economic fabric even as they sustain a polyglot web of cultures and languages.
Like generations of immigrants before him, Negussie was still grappling with his new American identity when he took his oath of citizenship last week at a Redwood City ceremony hosted by the International Institute of the Bay Area, one of dozens of organizations descended from Bremer's 1910 community center in Manhattan.
"It means a lot to me, the whole freedom and all that, but I'm still trying to understand what it means," said Negussie, an Ethiopian immigrant and biomedical engineer.
"You're giving up your country.
I'm still digesting it."
Bremer believed that immigrants did not have to submit to a uniform American identity; they could transition into U.S. society, become citizens and learn English while preserving the values, heritage and languages they brought with them.
And they could use some help, she said, preferably from fellow immigrants who could ease them into a new culture and economy.
