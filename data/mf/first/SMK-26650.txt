Smoke-filled spectator galleries
The U.S. Open tournament at Merion Golf Club will draw thousands of spectators, so it's no wonder the event has been meticulously planned.
Ticketholders' booklets provide a long list of prohibited items, and thoroughly detail transportation options, etiquette, and safety guidelines.
But despite all the preparations, one major area has been omitted: smoking restrictions.
Many other sporting events have prohibited smoking by spectators for years.
As a longtime United States Golf Association member and attendee at many U.S. Open events, I can attest that secondhand smoke - particularly cigar smoke - is prevalent.
Crowded areas around greens, often three and four deep with spectators, including children, reek of cigars.
It's almost impossible to walk from hole to hole without inhaling smoke.
To avoid such unhealthy fumes, spectators must move - until the next cigar smoker approaches and exhales without regard for anyone else.
The USGA should join the 21st century and protect the health and enjoyment of its patrons by restricting smoking to designated areas.

Union job sites less prone to risk
Demolition is a skilled trade requiring training and close supervision.
Union-labor rules require apprenticeships, thousands of hours of instruction, and on-the-job training to ensure competence and safety.
Fly-by-night contractors seem only interested in enhancing their returns and don't appear at all interested in protecting anyone but themselves.
Workers at 22d and Market Streets weren't wearing hard hats.
They were working with inadequate lighting.
They failed to properly brace a wall.
Improper equipment was used.
