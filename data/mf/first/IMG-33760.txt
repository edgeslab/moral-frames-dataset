Romney Says He Would Honor Immigration Reprieves Granted by Obama
Responding to pressure from Latino groups to clarify his immigration views, Mitt Romneytold The Denver Post late Monday that he would not cancel temporary reprieves from deportation that President Obama is granting to hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants.
"The people who have received the special visa that the president has put in place, which is a two-year visa, should expect that the visa would continue to be valid," Mr. Romney said in an interview aboard his campaign bus two days before he meets Mr. Obama in a debate in Denver.
"I'm not going to take something that they've purchased," he said.
He added, "Before those visas have expired, we will have the full immigration reform plan that I've proposed."
It was unclear what Mr. Romney meant when he called the deferrals "something that they've purchased," but he may have been referring to the $465 application fee, which is steep for many immigrant families.
The program is financed by the fees.
As he returned to Colorado, where Latino voters could help decide who carries the battleground state, Mr. Romney had been repeatedly pressed about his approach to the Obama administration's program, which gives two-year deferrals of deportation to young undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children.
Despite repeated questions at a Sept. 19 town hall meeting in Miami broadcast by Univision, a Spanish-language network, Mr. Romney declined to say whether he would continue the program, which has been highly popular in Latino and immigrant communities.
He did say he would not support any mass roundup and deportation of illegal immigrants.
