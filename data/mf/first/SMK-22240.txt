Cain Gets Tough Treatment for Video's Cigarette Scene
WASHINGTON -  Had Herman Cain known he would be running into a human buzzsaw named Bob Schieffer on Sunday, he might have had second thoughts about including a now infamous scene at the end of his new campaign video that shows his chief of staff, Mark Block, coolly smoking a cigarette.
Or so it seemed on CBS's "Face the Nation" when Mr. Cain, the former pizza company executive known for his perpetually cheerful disposition, found himself being sternly dressed down by Mr. Schieffer almost like a misbehaving schoolboy - not the treatment presidential candidates normally expect from a  Sunday television interviewer.
The Internet video, posted last week, has a quirky ending - the scene of Mr. Block blowing smoke is followed by one of Mr. Cain breaking into a slow grin -- and it has already been viewed by close to 1 million people.
But Mr. Schieffer failed to see the humor in it.
"Was it meant to be funny?"
he asked bluntly.
"It's not funny to me - I am a cancer survivor, like you.
I had cancer that's smoking-related.
I don't think it serves the country well - this is an editorial opinion - to be showing someone smoking a cigarette, and you're the front-runner now and it seems to me that as front-runner you would have a responsibility not to take that kind of a tone."
