For young Maryland immigrants, a path out of the shadows
They call themselves "shadows" - young Maryland residents brought to this country as children by their parents.
They worked hard.
They excelled in our public schools.
They want to go to college so they can be more productive members of our workforce.
They do not ask for a free ride.
Yet they remain shadows because their parents came without immigration papers.
The Maryland Dream Act would bring these young people into daylight.
If upheld in a referendum by Maryland voters on Nov. 6, the Dream Act would allow these undocumented young people to pay in-state tuition rates at Maryland's public universities - provided that they meet stringent requirements.
As an American citizen by choice, I will vote in favor of the Dream Act.
It is fair, just and economically beneficial to our state.
I staked my claim on the American Dream five decades ago.
A "Latasian" (Latino-Asian) - I grew up in Latin America speaking Spanish at school and Chinese at home - I came to the United States alone, as a teenager.
I worked my way through college and became a lawyer, educator and university president.
At that time, exclusionary quotas limited the number of immigrants from certain countries.
Congress later repealed these and widened the doors to citizenship.
I remember well those uncertain times, so I empathize with today's young shadows.
My journey - and those of countless other immigrants who came before and after me - would be remarkable in almost any country other than the United States.
We are a nation of nations.
Most Americans have a hyphenated identity.
We owe a great deal of our national vitality and success to the enduring dreams and hard work of immigrants.
