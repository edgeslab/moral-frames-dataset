Push for graphic images on cigarette packs blocked
A federal judge formally blocked new rules that would have forced tobacco companies to display graphic images on packs of cigarettes that were designed to shock consumers and  deter them from smoking.
The Wednesday  ruling, which was presaged by a temporary injunction issued by the same judge in November, strikes a blow to one of the government's most aggressive efforts to prevent deaths linked to cigarettes.
At issue were regulations published by the Food and Drug Administration last year in response to congressional legislation.
The rules required tobacco firms to affix large warning labels to cigarette packages, cartons and advertising.
The warnings were to include such images as a bare-chested cadaver and a man exhaling cigarette smoke through a tracheotomy hole.
The Justice Department, which appealed the temporary restraining order, is also expected to appeal Wednesday's ruling.
Some of the country's largest cigarette makers, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco and Lorillard, sued to block the requirements, arguing that they were too broad and violated the companies' First Amendment rights.
The Justice Department, which represented the FDA, countered in court papers that the images were effective in conveying the dangers of cigarette smoking.
The White House called the labels "common-sense measures that will help prevent children from smoking."
U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leonof the District's federal court initially sided with the tobacco firms in issuing the temporary restraining orderthat blocked the new rules.
In his 19-page Wednesday opinion, Leon reiterated that analysis.
