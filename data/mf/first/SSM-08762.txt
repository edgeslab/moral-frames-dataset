Marriage is understood as an intrinsically male-female union
According to Dave Godfrey ("Gay people deserve Constitution's equal protection," Dec. 11), the failure of most states to recognize same-sex unions as marriages violates the 14th Amendment, which guarantees everyone "the equal protection of the laws."
He would be correct only if the true and natural definition of marriage (i.e., what it really is, independently of how lawmakers choose to define it) were "a committed union between any two persons."
For only in that case would those states be denying to same-sex couples a legal status to which both they and heterosexual couples are equally entitled according to natural justice.
However, such a "gender-neutral" definition of marriage contradicts the virtually unanimous consensus of all humanity until only about 20 years ago, when homosexual militants started actively campaigning to redefine marriage (thereby paving the way for still further redefinitions in the future).
Marriage has always been understood as an intrinsically male-female union, since only such unions have the biological potential for procreation and the formation of natural families.
Its norms of permanence and fidelity are motivated by the best interests of the children who usually result from that relationship.
Judging by what is happening in Vermont, Massachusetts, etc., granting "marital" status to same-sex unions actually causes, rather than eliminates, violations of the 14th Amendment - not to mention the First, which guarantees free exercise of religion.
For Christians and other believers in traditional marriage now find themselves increasingly discriminated against by law and society, and contemptuously stereotyped and marginalized as "bigots," "homophobes" and "haters."
