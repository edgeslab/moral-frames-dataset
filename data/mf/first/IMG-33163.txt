Obama Policy On Immigrants Is Challenged By Chicago
Just weeks after the Supreme Court largely reaffirmed the Obama administration's immigration enforcement powers in its legal battle with Arizona, federal officials are facing a new, politically tricky clash with local authorities over immigration, this time in Chicago.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he would propose an ordinance that would bar police officers from turning over illegal immigrants to federal agents if the immigrants do not have serious criminal convictions or outstanding criminal warrants.
In contrast to the Obama administration's long-running confrontation with officials in Arizona, who are mostly Republicans, the latest challenge to the president's immigration policies comes from Mr. Emanuel, his former chief of staff, and from other Democratic allies in President Obama's hometown.
''If you have no criminal record, being part of a community is not a problem for you,'' Mr. Emanuel said, speaking at a high school library in Little Village, a Latino neighborhood.
''We want to welcome you to the city of Chicago.''
The mayor said the proposal was part of his goal to make Chicago the ''most immigrant-friendly city in the country.''
While Arizona sought to authorize the state and local police to enforce immigration laws more strictly than federal policy, officials in Chicago and surrounding Cook County want to ease the impact of enforcement on immigrant neighborhoods by restraining the local police and restricting the action of federal agents.
The Supreme Court ruled on the Arizona law on June 25, striking down most of the controversial parts.
