U.S. Judge Strikes Down F.D.A.
Cigarette Labels
A federal judge on Wednesday declared unconstitutional a Food and Drug Administration requirement that tobacco companies prominently display graphic warning labels on cigarette packages.
Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington ruled that forcing the companies to use the labels, which show staged images like a man breathing smoke out of a tracheotomy hole in his neck and a mouth punctured with what appear to be cancerous lesions, violated their free speech rights under the First Amendment.
''The government's interest in advocating a message cannot and does not outweigh plaintiff's First Amendment right to not be the government's messenger,'' Judge Leon wrote.
His ruling largely echoed arguments he made in a preliminary injunction he issued in November.
The significance of Wednesday's ruling is unclear, since the Obama administration has appealed the injunction.
''This decision adds nothing to the existing record,'' said Matthew L. Myers, a lawyer and president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group.
''It represents an inaccurate statement of the facts, is wrong on the science of the health impact of tobacco and uses the wrong legal standards.
Other than that, he got it perfect.''
Five tobacco companies -- R. J. Reynolds, Lorillard, Commonwealth Brands, the Liggett Group and Santa Fe Natural -- challenged the labels, arguing that the government was trying to use their packaging not to inform and educate consumers but to advocate a change in behavior.
