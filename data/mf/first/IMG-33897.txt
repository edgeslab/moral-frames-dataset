California Sheriffs Oppose Bill on Illegal Immigrants
LOS ANGELES -- Some California sheriffs are pushing back against a proposed state law that would bar law enforcement officers from detaining illegal immigrants for deportation if they have not been charged with serious or violent crimes.
The bill, which the Legislature sent on Friday to Gov.
Jerry Brown, would create what opponents have called a ''sanctuary'' for illegal immigrants statewide.
It sets up a new fight over immigration enforcement that comes as Republicans vow at their national convention in Florida to impose sanctions on states, cities and counties that adopt similar measures.
Known as the Trust Act, the bill would require police officers to ignore requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain immigrants for deportation, except when suspects are charged with serious or violent crimes.
Mr. Brown has not indicated where he stands on the proposed law; he must sign or veto it by Sept. 30.
But some local authorities, including Sheriff Lee Baca of Los Angeles County, say that they will continue to enforce federal policy regardless of what Mr. Brown does.
''It's pretty simple: Federal law pre-empts state law,'' said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for Sheriff Baca.
Law enforcement officials in San Diego and Riverside Counties have also expressed dismay with the Trust Act.
Sheriff Robert T. Doyle of Marin County said his ''gut reaction would be to ignore it,'' adding, ''If someone comes to the county jail and he is not here lawfully, I think he should be turned over'' to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
