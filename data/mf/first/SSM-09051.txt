Wisconsin appeals court upholds state's domestic partnership law
A state appeals court Friday, Dec. 21, upheld Wisconsin's domestic partnership law, writing in a decision that it does not violate the state's marriage amendment.
A three-judge panel of the 4th District Court of Appeals wrote in the decision that Wisconsin Family Action's Julaine Appling had failed to show that the state's domestic partnership law, enacted in 2009, was prohibited by the marriage amendment.
"The same-sex domestic partnerships created by the Legislature are substantially different than marriages because, among other differences, domestic partnerships carry with them substantially fewer rights and obligations than those enjoyed by and imposed on married couples," Judge Paul Lundsten wrote for the court.
The case, Lundsten wrote, was not about whether the state and federal constitutions require that same-sex couples have the right to a legally recognized relationship that is identical or similar to marriage.
Instead, supporters of the partnership law had to show only that the legal status created by the law wasn't "substantially similar" to marriage.
The evidence presented to the court, he wrote, persuaded it that the two are not.
The marriage amendment, ratified by voters in 2006, defines marriage as being between a man and a woman.
It also says that a legal status identical or substantially similar to marriage for unmarried individuals will not be recognized.
The domestic partnership law grants same-sex couples protections such as the right to visit each other in hospitals, make end-of-life decisions and inherit one another's property.
