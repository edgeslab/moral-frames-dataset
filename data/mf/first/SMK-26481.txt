Higher tobacco tax would improve education, public health in Missouri
I strongly support the initiative that will appear on the November ballot to raise Missouri's lowest-in-the-nation tobacco tax and use the proceeds for education and public health.
The severe budget and health problems facing our state are well-known.
Missouri spends more money under Medicaid to provide health care for smoking-related illnesses (more than $500 million annually) than it collects from the entire cigarette tax rate.
Missouri's tobacco tax is 17 cents per pack.
The national average state tax is $1.49 per pack.
It is no wonder why, sadly, Missouri has some of the highest rates of smoking, lung cancer and heart disease in the country.
Illinois just raised its tax by $1 to $1.98 per pack.
Missouri is one of only three states that has not increased its tobacco tax in 10 years.
Now is the time to act.
The American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association are among the growing list of supporters who have organized around an initiative to raise the state tobacco tax rate to 90 cents per pack and close the Non-Participating Manufacturers tax loophole.
The much-needed revenue from this tax and other tobacco taxes would generate an estimated $280 million annually with 50 percent of the proceeds going to elementary and secondary public education in Missouri, 30 percent for public higher education and 20 percent for public health, including tobacco use prevention and cessation assistance.
