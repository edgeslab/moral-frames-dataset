Undocumented immigrants seek deportation protection at Richmond summit
RICHMOND -- It was June when President Barack Obama announced the deferred action program, whereby qualified undocumented immigrants may receive two years of protection from deportation.
By October, applications were pouring in at the rate of 5,328 per day.
The flow slowed as Election Day neared and fears among immigrants mounted that a Republican administration might repeal the program.
Now, with Obama having been re-elected and Democrats having made gains in Congress:
"I think you've already seen a number of Republican senators saying they have to give serious consideration to immigration reform," said Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), who hosted a deferred action summit Saturday at DeJean Middle School.
"The Dream Act is probably the one they're most comfortable with.
I think if you put it to a vote today, it would pass."
Deferred action is still new enough to be considered a revelation to some undocumented immigrants.
"Who would have thought five years ago that we would be able to apply for a work permit, or drive a car without being afraid of being pulled over by a cop?"
Carlos Martinez, master of ceremonies for Saturday's event, asked a crowd of about 150.
The summit provided resources, including translation services, for those interested in applying.
Catholic Charities, RYSE Youth Center, International Rescue Committee and the U.S. Department of Labor had information tables in the school's multiuse room.
