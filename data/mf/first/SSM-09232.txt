Josh Mandel taking heat from the in-laws; Some of Mandel's cousins object to his views on gay marriage.
Any political candidate knows to expect attacks - sharp, personal or unfair - from an opponent.
But you know things are tough when you get hammered by your own family.
That's what happened last week when some of Ohio State Treasurer and GOP Senate candidate  Josh Mandel's cousins (on his wife's side)  took out a paid ad in the Cleveland Jewish News that blistered and even belittled him for his views on gay marriage and gays in the military.
Mandel married into the prominent, wealthy (think mega-builders) and sprawling Ratner family, nine of whom signed the "Dear Josh" letter.
"Four years ago you came into our family," they began,  and "how happy our family members were as they described it afterwards.
"So we were deeply saddened," they said, during the Oct. 18 debate with incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, where he talked about his views on those issues.
"Your cousins, Ellen Ratner and Cholene Espinoza," the letter noted,   married in Massachusetts eight years ago, so "it hurts us that you would embrace discrimination against them.

"Like you, Cholene spent many years in the armed forces.

she became the second woman in history to fly the U-2 reconnaissance plane.
And yet, you have argued that she, like many gay and lesbian soldiers, should be forced to live a life of secrecy and lies."
