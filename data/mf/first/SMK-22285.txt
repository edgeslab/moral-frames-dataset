Cigar retailers hope to set smoldering market ablaze
In Naples, Fla., Rocky Patel has established for cigar smokers a sanctum called Burn Loungewhere they can light up to their hearts' content, imbibe spirits, and enjoy their guilty pleasure without worrying about being banished to the great outdoors.
Now he wants to open such a lounge on Capitol Hill next year, a space between 3,500 and 4,500 square feet that would accommodate up to 350 people, the capacity of his Florida lounge.
Patel and a growing number of retailers say they see great potential in the Washington cigar market, and they are making moves to better cater to the region's power brokers.
"It would be great to have a venue [on Capitol Hill] where congressmen and senators or aides could appreciate the art form called cigar smoking," Patel said of his prospective lounge.
Veronica Jeon and Tony Marshall are chief executive and managing partner, respectively, of JIVI Management and Consulting, a Washington-based firm that advises clients on human resources.
Based on what they heard from several clients who were interested in a business-focused cigar establishment, Jeon and Marshall  recently announced plans to build Puff Restaurant and Lounge, a 6,000-square-feet members-only lounge at 1831 M St. NW.
The enterprise will be fronted by a smoke-free, publicly accessible Cajun restaurant, with the lounge above, Jeon said.
Membership costs are to range from $1,000 to $10,000, and include amenities such as access to humidor lockers, retail discounts and a complimentary smoking jacket.
The basic bronze membership will offer unlimited access and one guest per visit.
