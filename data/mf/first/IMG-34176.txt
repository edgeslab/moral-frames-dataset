Green-card pragmatism
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S lopsided margin of victory among Hispanic voters in the presidential election alarmed Republicans and stirred hopes on Capitol Hill that an overhaul of the nation's crippled immigration rules might just be possible.
But as they prepare to dance their latest minuet on reforming a broken system, each party is starting with steps that the other finds unpalatable.
For the second time in three months, Republicans are pushing a bill that would create 55,000 additional green cards annually for foreign students who receive graduate degrees at U.S. universities in science, technology, engineering and math - so-called STEM graduates.
On its own, that's a fine idea, and a bipartisan one at that; as things stand, too many of these highly sought students are forced to leave the country upon graduation, to the detriment of U.S. competitiveness.
But the GOP measure, which was approved by the House of Representatives on Friday, comes at a cost: The 55,000 visas would be derived by eliminating a similar number of green cards disbursed by the so-called diversity lottery, a 20-year-old program that awards visas mainly to low-skilled Africans and Eastern Europeans.
On top of having been a brilliant public diplomacy tool for the United States, the lottery has offered a lifeline for the sorts of immigrants who have energized this nation for decades by their pluck and drive.
Democrats are willing to expand STEM visas, but many are rightly reluctant to sacrifice the lottery.
So the bill is likely dead on arrival in the Senate.
