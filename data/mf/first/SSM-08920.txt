Historic law is approved in Maryland
Voters in Maryland narrowly upheld the state's same-sex marriage law, a historic victory for the national gay-rights movement that highlights the country's evolving definition of marriage.
Before Tuesday, gays and lesbians had been granted the right to marry by courts and state legislatures, but proponents of marriage had been defeated at the ballot box in more than 30 states.
Maryland was joined by Maine in approving gay marriage, making the two states' voters the first in the country to approve the measures by a popular vote.
In Maryland, gay couples will be able to wed starting Jan. 1.
As they watched the results at a Baltimore club and sensed victory, Ruth Siegel and Nina Nethery, together for 15 years, said they felt joyous.
They were surrounded by hundreds of supporters of the referendum to legalize same sex marriage.
"It's being part of history," said Nethery, 59, a systems analyst who lives with Siegel in Silver Spring. "
I'm in history."
Maryland voters also approved the Dream Act, allowing undocumented immigrants to receive in-state college tuition rates.
A measure that allows a new casino in Prince George's County was narrowly approved.
Several of the votes - most notably Question 6, the same-sex marriage measure - carried political consequences for Gov.
Martin O'Malley (D).
Marylanders were asked whether to affirm the gay marriage law championed this year by the governor that was put on hold after opponents gathered enough signatures to force a public vote.
