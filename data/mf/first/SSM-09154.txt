Benefits expansion for domestic partners would have small impact on costs, CBO says
Extending federal employee health insurance and retirement survivor benefits to same-sex domestic partners wouldhave arelatively small impact on the number of people covered and on the cost of those programs, according to an analysis done for Congress.
A Congressional Budget Office cost estimate released Mondayexamined a bill to make those partners eligiblefor the full range of benefits that apply to opposite-sex spouses offederal employees and retirees.
The measure passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in May but has not advanced.
The bipartisan sponsors say that the federal government should expand its benefits as a matter of fairness and to keep up with employers that include same-sex partners in their benefit programs.
Currently, same-sex partners are eligible under some federal employee family benefits, such as counseling programs and certain travel and relocation payments.
They also are eligible for the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program, for which the government makes no contributions toward premiums, and for a less generous form of a survivor benefit, called an "insurable interest" annuity.
Those benefits were extended to same-sex partners by a series of Obama administration actions.
However, legislation would be required to make those partners eligible for two of the most valuable benefits, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program coverage and standard retirement survivor annuities.
"CBO expects that few federal employees (less than 1 percent) would choose to register a same-sex domestic partnership if given the opportunity.
That figure is based on information from state and local governments as well as research on the experience of organizations that have adopted similar policies," CBO said.
