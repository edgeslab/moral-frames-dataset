Gay marriage, pot make progress; 'Represents a big change' in U.S. society
Decisions on ballot issues by voters in multiple states Tuesday produced potential watershed moments surrounding two social issues that have divided Americans for decades.
Approval of same-sex marriage and recreational use of marijuana came as a rebuke to longstanding federal policies -- the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and federal drug policies against marijuana.
Ballot measures that had failed for years on same-sex marriage  and drug decriminalization this time won approval.
Gay marriage supporters won in all four states where it was up for a vote.
Two states, Washington and Colorado, legalized the recreational use of marijuana, while Oregon defeated it.
Massachusetts approved marijuana for medical reasons, while Arkansas rejected it.
"This represents a big change in American society," says Jennie Bowser, a ballot issues expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Maine, Maryland and Washington legalized same-sex marriages.
Minnesota rejected a constitutional amendment banning them, though gay marriage remains illegal there.
The votes ended a 14-year, 32-state losing streak when the issue was put to voters instead of being decided by courts or legislatures and signal what some analysts call a cultural shift.
Public opinion on gay marriage is rapidly changing , heavily influenced by younger voters, said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California.
Polls have found "a huge differential on this issue in terms of age."
Voters over 50 are most opposed and voters 18 to 29 are most supportive of same-sex marriage.
"The generational divide is stark,'' he said.
