Gay marriage gets historic backing on Election 2012 ballots
Gay marriage rights were supported by popular vote on Tuesday in Maine and Maryland, and Washington state joined Wednesday afternoon, making it the first time gay men and lesbian rights were approved at the ballot box.
In Minnesota, voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have banned gay marriage, marking another victory for gay rights advocates, even though gay marriage remains illegal in the state.
"When the history books are written, 2012 will be remembered as the year when [lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender] Americans won decisively at the ballot box," said Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign.
"The dreams of millions of fair-minded Americans were realized as discrimination crumbled and equality prevailed."
HRC raised and contributed millions of dollars to advance marriage equality in all four states voting on gay marriage rights come Nov. 6.
The group contributed at least $800,000 to advance marriage equality in Maine and $2.8 million in Maryland.
The group also sent thousands of e-mails to supporters of marriage equality, as well as recruited hundreds of volunteers.
On Tuesday, 53 percent of voters in Maine voted in support of gay marriage versus 47 percent who voted against.
In Maryland, the referendum question 6 allowing same-sex marriages passed 52 percent to 48 percent.
And in Washington, about 52 percent of voters approved of same-sex marriage, versus 48 percent who voted against it.
