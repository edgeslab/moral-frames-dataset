pastors assess same-sex vote
For months, the Rev.
Delman Coates, 39, pastor of the Mount Ennon Baptist Church in Clinton, led the coalition of religious leaders in support of the Marriage Equality Bill in Maryland.
Meanwhile, the Rev.
Derrick McCoy, associate pastor of Hope Christian Church in Beltsville, led the effort to overturn the law through the Maryland Marriage Alliance.
After Maryland's same-sex marriage law was approved by voters on Tuesday,staff writer Hamil R. Harrisinterviewed both men.
Below are excerpts.
Rev.
Coates
Why do you think the referendum passed?
Marylanders passed Question 6 because they did not want to be on the side of legalized discrimination.
It was the perfect bill to provide civil protections for gay and lesbian couples and protect religious institutions that don't perform same-sex marriage.
What was the personal cost of being part of this effort?
I don't want to make this about me - it is about the children and families that will be protected now.
What will you do now?
This is the best year in the history of our church.
More than 1,000 people have joined our church in the first 10 months.
We now have more than 8,000 members.
I am going to try to focus on reentry for ex-offenders in the state of Maryland.
I am going to try to work with state legislators, where ex-offenders don't have to check the box when they fill out job applications, so they can get an opportunity for interviews.
