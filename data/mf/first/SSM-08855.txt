Suburban Md.
voters key to referendums' passage
Voters in the Washington suburbs were instrumental in the passage of Maryland ballot measures for same-sex marriage and in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, and they were a bastion of support for the expansion of gambling.
A Washington Post analysis of census and voting data shows marked differences in support for the three referendum questions.
The precinct-by-precinct analysis shows that the state was as divided as the country is on some issues, varying by race and ethnicity, income and geography.
Votes in favor of gay marriage, for example, were concentrated in Montgomery and Howard counties as well as in and around Baltimore.
The measure won in precincts that are predominantly white or so diverse that no racial or ethnic group predominates.
Support was highest in neighborhoods where the median household income tops $180,000.
Conversely, the gay marriage question failed, although by small margins, in precincts that are predominantly black or Hispanic and in the exurbs and rural stretches of the state.
It lost in most parts of socially conservative, affluent Prince George's County and in neighborhoods where the median household income dips below $50,000.
The Dream Act measure, granting in-state tuition to the children of immigrants who did not come to this country with proper documents, passed handily in almost all neighborhoods except those that are largely non-Hispanic white.
It won in white precincts in the suburbs around Washington, however.
