Bans gaining popularity
Norcross' economic development manager was concerned businesses might leave town.
The police chief fretted about devoting officers to police parks for illegal smokers.
The city manager wanted to know the best way to inform residents of the new tobacco ban.
Earlier this month, Norcross approved an ordinance banning use of all tobacco products at parks, sidewalks, recreational fields and city buildings, among other public places.
But in a recent workshop with anti-smoking advocates, city leaders came to understand the challenges faced by other municipalities that passed similar measures.
"Pushback is the norm, but we're trying to move forward," Michael Jackson, a program consultant with the state Department of Public Health, told city officials Wednesday.
"This is step one of a process for building normalcy for what is becoming the norm across the world."
Norcross is the latest in a string of metro Atlanta cities and counties --- including Alpharetta, Clayton and Duluth, among others --- to ban smoking or the use of tobacco products in public parks or spaces.
Cobb County is considering a similar measure that would ban smoking and tobacco use in all of its 77 parks and recreation locations.
Supporters argue the laws create healthier environments for residents, including protection from secondhand smoke.
But many others say the bans infringe on personal rights, hurt local restaurants and bars and represent improper expansion of government.
