Smokers say tax hike would make them quit - maybe
Hanging outside the Gallery on Market Street with her 6-month-old baby in a stroller, Dana Kinee drew on a cigarette, filling her lungs with the smoky satisfaction her body has craved since she was 9.
She started for the same reasons virtually every other smoker does - fitting in and being cool.
"I was trying to be like my older siblings," said Kinee, now 26.
Since she joined the 43.8 million fellow Americans who smoke, she has tried repeatedly to stop.
Nothing has worked.
Pennsylvania legislators are considering a bill that experts say would help - although that is not its main purpose.
The bill would let Philadelphia add $2 to each pack of cigarettes sold, bringing the average cost to $8.
The tax, proposed by Mayor Nutter, is projected to raise $89 million in its first year as part of a package to close the School District's $304 million funding gap.
City Council has approved the tax, and the Senate Finance Committee gave the proposal a preliminary nod Tuesday.
It still must clear the Senate and House.
The bill poses no immediate threat to Kinee's habit.
A price increase would not go into effect until Jan. 1.
If that happens, she said, she's done.
A new mother with no job, she struggles to find the money for cigarettes as it is.
"It's going to make me quit."
