Vote for Md.
's Question 6
IT WAS NOT very long ago that Americans could cite tradition as justification for opposing interracial marriage or for limiting the number of Jews admitted to some universities or for barring women from practically any position of power and influence.
But tradition's grip, while powerful, is not immutable, particularly in a country whose pride, founding principles and prestige rest so heavily on the promise of equal treatment under the law.
As it pertains to equal rights for homosexuals, that promise has made lightning gains in the past year, as the nation's fast-shifting attitudes toward same-sex marriage have been reflected in state legislatures, federal courts and the White House.
Now the voters of Maryland, along with those of three other states, can help make a reality of the promise of genuine equality for gay men and lesbians.
By voting forQuestion6 next week, Marylanders would ratify the state law allowing gay men and lesbians to wed. We hope they do.
More than 42 percent of Americans now live in states with some form of legal protection for gay couples, though just six states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage outright.
Only a narrow majority of Americans say they favor marriage rights for gay couples, but large majorities of young people say they are fine with it.
The trend line is clear, and the arguments against gay marriage are losing force.
