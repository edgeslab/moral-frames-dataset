New U.S. citizens pledging allegiance at Gettysburg
Easily overlooked in the hot debate about illegal immigration are the stories of legal immigrants such as Marek Weklicz, born in Poland and settled in Port Richmond, who waited a decade for permission to move to America.
On Monday, Weklicz and 15 other immigrants will pledge allegiance to the United States at a celebrity-studded ceremony in Gettysburg, where President Abraham Lincoln's stirring Gettysburg Address will be reenacted.
Each was randomly chosen by U.S. officials to symbolize the 3,400 people who become citizens every day.
In addition to the immigrants from 11 countries who will be sworn in, invitees include film director Steven Spielberg and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.
Lincoln's 149-year-old address "does an incredible job of defining who we are as a nation - 'a government of the people, by the people, for the people,' " National Park Service spokeswoman Katie Lawhon said.
"When these immigrants raise their hands to take the oath, that is exactly what they are committing to, that ideal."
For many, the goal of reaching America was a long time coming.
Marek Weklicz, his wife, Katarzyna, and their children, Anna and Piotr, began the process in 1991, when Marek's mother, a naturalized citizen living in Port Richmond, applied to reunite her family here.
From their apartment near Cracow, the Wekliczes used a U.S. government website to track their petition.
"It was moving, slowly, but it was moving," said Katarzyna, 46, called Kasia.
"After 9/11, everything stopped."
