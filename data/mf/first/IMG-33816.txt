Immigration movement: 'Dreamers' organize CLOUD group to help others avoid deportation
RICHMOND -- When Carlos Martinez was 11 years old, he jumped the border in Arizona between Mexico and the United States and made his way across a desert for four days and three nights with his younger sister and a group of about 20 other immigrants, led by a "coyote," a person paid to smuggle people into the country.
After the journey, Martinez and his sister joined their mother in Salinas.
He attended schools in the community and wanted to go to college but was told by his high school counselor that he couldn't, because he was undocumented.
"I was the first in my family to graduate from high school, so that was a big thing for my mom," the soft-spoken 23-year-old said recently.
"But I didn't know what was my future.
So, I worked cutting lettuce in the fields for six or seven months."
Martinez's future would not end in the fields.
Today, he is the co-founder of Community Leaders Organizing Undocumented Dreamers, or CLOUD.
The nascent group has already held two large outreach events for immigrants interested in applying for President Barack Obama's new deferred action program, which allows young illegal immigrants to avoid deportation for at least two years and apply for work permits and driver's licenses.
The core group, formed about three months ago, is collaborating with organizations such as Catholic Charities to help educate people about the law and screen them for eligibility.
And the group's young leaders are determined to help more people, with the goal of working toward wide-ranging changes in immigration law.
