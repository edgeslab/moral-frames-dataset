Mercury News editorial: Don't fall for Big Tobacco; Vote yes on Proposition 29
You think al-Qaida's a killer?
It has nothing on Big Tobacco: More than 1,000 Americans die every single day from tobacco-related illnesses.
Yet, amazingly, polls show Californians are falling for one of the sleaziest advertising campaigns in state history, courtesy of R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris.
Voters might actually reject Proposition 29, which would increase the tax on a cigarettes by $1 per pack.
Don't let it happen.
The proposition will prevent 228,000 young people from becoming addicts and cause 118,000 adults to quit smoking, based on experience from other cigarette tax increases across the nation, and it will save billions in public health costs.
Even if you believe the bogus assertions that the tax revenue will be wasted, just charging the tax will dramatically improve California's public health and its finances.
In March, before Big Tobacco went to work, 67 percent of voters said they favored Proposition 29, and 30 percent opposed it.
But a Public Policy Institute of California poll released last week showed only 53 percent of likely voters supporting the measure and 42 percent opposed.
Wake up, voters.
The cynical opposition to Proposition 29 argues that it will create another "Big Bureaucracy" in California to allocate the tax revenue to cancer and other public health research.
But administrative costs will be limited by law to 2 percent of revenues collected, a low operating margin.
And that $14 million cost is about a third of the $40 million tobacco companies are spending to defeat the measure.
That's how certain they are that it will cut into the roughly $6 billion a year in revenue they rake in from the state's 3.8 million smokers.
