Mercury News editorial: Vote yes on Prop.
29 to raise cigarette tax by $1
Big Tobacco will spend $40 million this spring to convince Californians that Proposition 29's $1 per pack tax increase on cigarettes is a fiscal fiasco.
Even some objective analysts are quibbling about how the money might be spent.
Here's our view.
If you took all the money from this tax, raked it into a big pile and set fire to it, Proposition 29 would still be a great deal.
Raising tobacco taxes reduces smoking, and that will save California taxpayers billions of dollars in medical costs, not to mention sparing millions of people the misery of addiction or of watching loved ones destroy their health.
Spending Propositon 29 tax dollars wisely is important, but it's not the most important thing.
Based on solid data from other tobacco tax increases, adding $1 to the per-pack tax in California would cause 118,000 adults to quit smoking and, perhaps more important, would prevent 228,000 young Californians from becoming addicts.
The state's current tobacco tax is just 87 cents a pack, far below the national average of $1.46 -- and even if Prop.
29 passes, California still would have the 25th highest tax in the nation.
So why hasn't the Legislature raised the tax?
Oh, it has tried.
And tried.
And tried -- 33 times in the past 30 years.
It succeeded only once, in 1993, adding a paltry 2 cents a pack for breast cancer research.
