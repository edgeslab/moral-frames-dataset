The 2005 movie Thank You for
Smoking features lobbyists for the tobacco, alcohol and firearms industries who meet in a bar each week and call themselves the Merchants of
Death, orMODSquad.
Since the movie, based on the satirical novel by Christopher Buckley, came out, both smoking and drunken driving have become less socially acceptable and more heavily regulated, despite industry lobbying.
These trends carry useful lessons as gun-control advocates try to mount a campaign for sensible new firearms restrictions in the wake of the horrific school shootings in Connecticut a week ago: Destructive public problems that seem intractable are not.
Interest groups that seem all powerful are not.
The combination of public policy and public disapproval is tremendously potent.
And though hard-wired cultural norms yield slowly, they can change, and change dramatically.
Take teenage smoking and drunken driving, behaviors that were once endemic.
The rates of both continued dropping last year, in some cases to historic lows.
In the early 1990s, it was tough to find any place where people didn't smoke.
Smokers were welcome in bars, restaurants, hotel rooms, lobbies, offices and even in government buildings.
Cigarette packs warned that smoking was dangerous, but teens, who think they'll live forever, were unimpressed.
By 1997, one in every three teenagers smoked.
And why wouldn't they?
It was cool and sexy.
