Washington: Border Guards Will Cease Acting as Interpreters
United States Border Patrol agents will no longer serve as interpreters when local law enforcement agencies request language help, according to a new decree issued by the Department of Homeland Security.
The new guidance said agents should refer such requests to private services often used by government agencies.
Seeking language help is a common practice among local law enforcement agencies in Washington State.
If a person is pulled over and can speak only Spanish, the Border Patrol is often called.
But immigration advocates complain that Border Patrol agents ask people questions about immigration and in some cases arrest immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally.
''The concept of language access should be without people being questioned about their immigration status,'' said Jorge L. BaroÃÅn, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a legal aid organization based in Seattle.
Immigrants have grown apprehensive about calling local law enforcement agencies if they know the Border Patrol will respond, he said.
