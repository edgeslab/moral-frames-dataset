GOP's harsh immigration stances repel a natural constituency
Hispanic voters represent one of the biggest opportunities for the Republican Party in winning the White House.
They skew conservative on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage.
They value hard work and have shown, in the case of former president George W. Bush, a willingness to support Republican candidates.
But today's GOP is  in the clutches of illegal-immigration hawks, the same people who helped torpedo Bush's efforts at comprehensive reform and who have pushed stringent laws in a number of states under GOP control.
Their dominance in the party is hampering one of its best opportunities to expand its base and position itself for the future.
To be sure, this week's Republican convention will not lack for Hispanic speakers.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, passed over for the No.
2 spot on the ticket, will introduce Mitt Romney on Thursday night.
New Mexico Gov.
Susana Martinez and Texas Senate candidate Ted Cruz are among the others getting slots.
Even so, the party's platform, endorsed just days before the convention, is hardly likely to help the party's outreach efforts.
It calls for a double fence along the nation's southern border.
It would also federalize  provisions in Arizona's controversial immigration law that are likely to result in discrimination against Hispanics who are here legally.
Positions like these help explain why, in polls, Romney has been unable to hit 30% support among Hispanic voters -- at a time when no Republican in the past five elections has won the presidency with less than 35%.
Bush narrowly won re-election in 2004 with 44% of the Hispanic vote, a high-water mark for GOP candidates.
