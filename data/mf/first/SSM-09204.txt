'The politics' of gay unions
Public Advocate of the United States, a conservative nonprofit organization led by Loudoun County Supervisor Eugene A. Delgaudio (R-Sterling), filed a motion Friday to dismiss a federal complaint alleging that the organization illegally used a same-sex couple's engagement photo on anti-gay-marriage campaign fliers in Colorado.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, a prominent civil rights organization that designated Public Advocate as a hate group this year, filed the complaint in September in U.S. District Court in Colorado.
The SPLC is representing Tom Privitere and Brian Edwards - a New Jersey couple pictured on the campaign mailers sent out by Public Advocate in June - and Kristina Hill, the photographer who copyrighted the image.
The original photograph, taken by Hill in 2010 and posted on Privitere and Edwards's wedding blog, shows the couple kissing in front of the New York skyline.
In one of two altered images featured on the widely distributed Public Advocate campaign flier, the city backdrop is replaced by a country setting, and a bright red banner with the words "State Senator Jean White's Idea of Family Values?"
cuts across the couple's chests.
The lawsuit alleges that Public Advocate's use of the image was in violation of federal copyright law.
It also says that the group did not have permission to use Privitere and Edwards's likenesses and that the unauthorized use of their photograph resulted in emotional trauma and threats against the couple.
