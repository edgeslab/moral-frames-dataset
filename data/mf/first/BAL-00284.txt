The dispute over Freddie Gray's knife raises an obvious question: Why are switchblades illegal?
After Gray's death, Baltimore police said they found an illegal switchblade knife in his pocket.
But when Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced charges against six officers involved in Gray's arrest and transport, she made a point of saying that "the knife was not a switchblade knife and is lawful under Maryland law."
Now a lawyer for one of the cops is demanding to see the weapon to confirm that it was, as he suspects, prohibited.
Even if it was, Gray's possession of the knife wouldn't justify his being chased and arrested, since the police had no grounds to suspect he had it.
But the dispute raises an obvious question: Why are switchblades illegal?
Knives in general are not.
In most places you can carry a fixed or folding knife in your pocket without running afoul of the law.
Switchblades have a spring-loaded action that opens them with the push of a button.
And the reason they were forbidden is that in the 1950s, when Congress passed the federal law, lawmakers thought they were deadly weapons with no legitimate use.
If you've seen "West Side Story," you can confirm the identification of switchblades with juvenile delinquents and gangs.
But in an age where citizens can get permits to carry loaded guns in public, it's hard to justify the prohibition.
Switchblades are no more lethal than any other knife, and the automatic opening is not likely to make a difference to a criminal intent on mayhem.
That feature, however, makes them useful to anyone (say, a construction worker or hunter) who needs to open a knife with one hand.
The ban, like the federal law against "assault weapons," was based on mistaken perceptions and lurid myths, and it probably prevents no crime.
Gray's knife may have been illegal, but it shouldn't be.
