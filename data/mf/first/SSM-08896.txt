Voters endorse social-issue firsts
The election produced groundbreaking steps on a pair of social issues, as voters endorsed same-sex marriage in four states and legalization of marijuana in two.
"Think of this as the Will and Gracification of America," Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, says of the gay marriage vote.
"Programs like Will and Grace and Glee are having a similar effect as the Cosby Show did back in the 1980s."
Future implications for the nation -- in politics and policy -- could prove dramatic.
Gay marriage, once so controversial that opponents used the issue to demonize liberal backers, won victories in Maine, Maryland and Washington.
Minnesota rejected a constitutional amendment banning gay unions.
Schnur says polls show the young are far more liberal about gay marriage than those over 50, and far more likely to know openly gay people.
Colorado and Washington approved legalizing marijuana for recreational use, defying a federal prohibition since the 1930s.
Just two years ago, California rejected marijuana legalization, and many states have acted to ban gay marriage in the past.
