Minnesota: Gay-marriage advocates debate next move
Minnesotans just defeated an attempt to prohibit gay marriage in their constitution, but does that mean they'd support changing state law to allow gays and lesbians to marry?
And if so, is now the time?
Those were among the questions being debated at a daylong conference Saturday, Dec. 1, in Minneapolis.
The event, organized by OutFront Minnesota, drew several hundred activists to a downtown hotel to talk about where to direct their energies next.
Marriage was not the only issue on the table -- sessions also focused on health care, safe schools and other issues -- but the potential for legalizing gay marriage was drawing lots of interest given the recent election result.
"I don't think I have any choice but to ask that we move forward" with gay marriage, said Bobby Long of Minneapolis.
"We don't lose anything by trying, I don't think.
We just have to just keep pushing forward.
We can't let it stall out now."
"I'm just worried that we might alienate some people," said Corey Dahl of Minneapolis.
"In my heart, I really want marriage equality to move forward, but if we move too fast, I think we might stop the momentum.
"A lot of this campaign was about keeping the conversation open versus charging full-steam ahead for marriage equality," Dahl added.
No votes were taken at the gathering -- held on World AIDS Day -- and leaders made clear they're not launching an immediate, exclusive push for gay marriage.
