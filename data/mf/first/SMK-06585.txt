Support for new California tobacco tax drops
SACRAMENTO -- A ubiquitous TV ad campaign by tobacco companies has cut significantly into the support for a tobacco-tax initiative with less than two weeks to go before the election.
Voters back Proposition 29 by 53 percent to 42 percent, but that represents a steep drop from a much stronger base of support earlier this year, according to a poll released Wednesday by the Public Policy Institute of California.
Only two months earlier, two-thirds of likely voters said they would vote to increase taxes on cigarettes by $1 a pack to support cancer research.
"The large drop in support for Proposition 29 speaks loudly about how a well-funded opposition is able to raise voters' doubts and distrust in state government, even when a tax increase is viewed favorably," said Mark Baldassare, the institute's president and CEO.
With the outcome now more in doubt, tobacco giants Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds are expected, in the final days of the campaign, to pour more money on top of the $40 million they have already contributed to stop the tax.
In the same poll, 63 percent of voters said they generally support taxes on tobacco products, but since the No on 29 campaign began running ads six weeks ago, it has focused largely on the bureaucracy that the new funds would create, as well as the possibility that the revenues raised from the tax -- roughly $700 million annually -- could be spent by out-of-state research facilities.
