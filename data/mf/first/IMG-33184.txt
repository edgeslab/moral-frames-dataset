California's 'Trust Act' bill limiting deportations
Limiting local deportation actions
The state Senate and Assembly have passed a first-in-the-nation measure that would limit local law enforcers' compliance with federal immigration rules requiring them to report to immigration authorities all arrested people suspected as illegal immigrants.
After Senate approval Thursday, final Assembly approval is expected in August, which would send the measure to Gov.
Jerry Brown's desk.
AB-1081, "The Trust Act," declares that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's reliance on local law enforcers to detain illegal immigrant suspects for deportation review: Shifts a federal responsibility to local police, "undercutting community policing strategies" Drains local resources because the federal government does not pay the full cost of detaining suspects Requires no warrant, proof or probable cause and have been wrongly placed on U.S. citizens.
Harms community policing because immigrant residents who are crime victims or witnesses are less likely to report crimes or cooperate with police when that could result in their deportation.
The legislation would require that:
n No one shall be detained on the basis of an immigration hold after becoming eligible for release from criminal custody, unless, both of the following conditions are satisfied: The individual has been convicted of a serious or violent felony, according to a criminal background check or documentation provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and The continued detention on an immigration hold would not violate any federal, state, or local law, or any local policy.
