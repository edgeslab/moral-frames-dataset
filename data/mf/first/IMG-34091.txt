Georgia college mergers win important approval
The University System of Georgia moved one step closer Tuesday to officially merging some of its colleges.
An accreditation agency approved allowing the State Board of Regents to merge eight existing colleges into four.
None of the campuses will close, and officials said savings would be funneled into academic programs so that students in smaller communities will have access to more courses and degree programs.
The college pairings are: Augusta State and Georgia Health Sciences universities; Waycross and South Georgia colleges; Macon State and Middle Georgia colleges; and Gainesville State College and North Georgia College & State University.
Enforcement of state's immigration law to vary
Some state and local police might decide not to enforce a central part of Georgia's sweeping immigration law, and those who do will rely heavily on federal authorities for information, state law enforcement officials are predicting.
Georgia's law gives police the option to investigate the immigration status of suspects they believe have committed state or federal crimes and who cannot provide identification or other information that could help police identify them.
It also authorizes police to detain people determined to be in the country illegally and take them to jail.
On Tuesday, a federal judge lifted a preliminary injunction he had issued against the law last year.
