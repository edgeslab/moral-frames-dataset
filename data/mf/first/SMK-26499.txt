Pulmonary disease in women is increasing
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the most common lung diseases and is the third leading cause of death in the United States.
For several years now, women have outpaced men in terms of deaths related to the disease.
COPD actually includes two types of conditions: chronic bronchitis, a chronic cough accompanied by mucus formation, and emphysema, a respiratory disease characterized by the destruction of air sacs and trapping of air in the lungs.
In many cases, those with COPD have both chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
Smoking is one of the leading risk factors for COPD, with approximately 90 percent of deaths caused by smoking.
In fact, female smokers are approximately 13 times more likely to die from COPD than women who have never smoked.
Other risk factors for COPD include air pollution, secondhand smoke, dust, chemicals, genetics, childhood respiratory infections and socioeconomic factors.
A recent study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that the incidence of COPD in women is on the rise.
It found that more than 6 percent of women now have the disease, while 4 percent of men suffer from it.
Researchers believe the increase in women who have COPD is due to the number of women who started smoking in the 1970s and 1980s.
Although there is no cure for COPD, there are treatment options.
The diagnosis is often made with a chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests and when symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough and multiple respiratory infections are present.
Treatment can help ease or relieve symptoms.
They include bronchodilators to open the airways, inhaled steroids, oral anti-inflammatory medications, oxygen, nebulized medications and, in some cases, lung transplantation or volume reduction surgery.
