Snuff it out
BIG-LEAGUE BASEBALL'S season has begun with a rule change for players, who will no longer spit, squirt and dribble tobacco juice as they conduct televised interviews, sign autographs or appear at team-sponsored events.
It's a half measure, at best: During games, players can still use chewing tobacco and dip to their heart's content.
But given that major leaguers are role models for children, and that smokeless tobacco is a serious health risk, it's a move in the right direction.
As cigarette smoking has declined, at least in the United States, tobacco companies have responded by pushing other tobacco products, including the smokeless variety.
The industry's advertising targets young people, and it works: A survey in 2009 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 15 percent of high school boys were using smokeless tobacco, a 36 percent increase over six years.
Like cigarettes, smokeless tobacco contains nicotine, which makes it addictive.
While it may not be quite as lethal as cigarettes, it does raise the risk of cancer, heart disease and gum disease, among other ailments.
According to the Mayo Clinic, "You can call chewing tobacco by whatever name you want - smokeless tobacco, spit tobacco, chew, snuff, pinch or dip - but don't call it harmless."
That message has started to catch on, though it's no match for the hundreds of millions of dollars that tobacco companies have poured into marketing their smokeless products.
One key test is in Maryland, where lawmakers are considering a bill that would raise levies on various tobacco products - including smokeless ones, cigarillos, small cigars and the like - so they are on par with the $2-a-pack level at which cigarettes are taxed.
