Children brought here illegally before they could walk or talk would have no hope of working here legally without joining the military.
More resources would be directed toward guarding the U.S.-Mexico border, but little would be done to increase legal entry for the low-wage workers major industries like agriculture rely on.
If President Obama were re-elected, he says, he would push for more sensible and comprehensive immigration reform.
He would call for changes to federal law that allow a path to citizenship for millions of productive but undocumented American workers, and a chance for children raised here illegally to one day be full-fledged Americans.
But because he has done so little to advance that goal, his vow has little credibility.
