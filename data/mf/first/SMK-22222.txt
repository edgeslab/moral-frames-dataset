F.D.A.
: 1,200 Stores Violated Bans on Tobacco Sales to Minors
Over the last year, the Food and Drug Administration gave $24 million to 37 states and the District of Columbia to improve enforcement of laws banning the sale of cigarettes to people under 18 years old.
On Thursday, the agency said sting operations with underage buyers had resulted in notices of violation to 1,200 stores in the first 15 states that conducted the new round of inspections.
"They are discovering that selling cigarettes to minors is not only wrong, it's a violation of federal law," Dr. Lawrence Deyton, director of the F.D.A.
Center for Tobacco Products, said in a conference call with reporters.
While states have long banned cigarette (and alcohol) sales to minors and mounted enforcement efforts from time to time, the 2009 tobacco legislation passed by Congress for the first time set national standards and enforcement authority, effective June 2010.
A first violation gets a warning letter, while a second violation can result in a $250 fine, and five violations within 36 months can result in a ban on a store from selling tobacco, said Ann Simoneau, director of compliance and enforcement for the tobacco center.
She said minors trying to buy cigarettes in the sting operations are accompanied by adults.
Paul Dabhi, manager of a Quick Stop store in Erie, Pa., said he took a number of steps to assure his store would no longer sell to teenagers after receiving a Sept. 29 warning letter from the F.D.A.
The letter said an unidentified clerk sold a pack of Newport Box 100 cigarettes to a minor on June 29.
