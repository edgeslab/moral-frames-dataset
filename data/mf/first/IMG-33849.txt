Record Number of Foreigners Were Deported in 2011, Officials Say
Immigration enforcement authorities detained and deported record numbers of illegal immigrants in 2011 and are on track for similar figures this year, even as the numbers of migrants crossing the border illegally dropped to a 40-year low, according to data published Friday by the Department of Homeland Security.
Immigration agents deported 391,953 foreign-born people during the 2011 fiscal year, the department's Office of Immigration Statistics reported.
They included more than 188,000 people who had been convicted of crimes in the United States -- an ''all-time high'' for such deportations, the report found.
Citizens of four Latin American countries -- Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- made up 93 percent of all people deported last year.
With just one month to go in the 2012 fiscal year, deportations were down slightly, with just over 366,000 people expelled through Aug. 31.
But they include more than 191,000 convicted criminals, more than last year, according to figures from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, one of several agencies in the department.
The figures provide a backdrop to the administration's political calculations on the thorny issue of immigration as President Obama heads into the last stretch before the November elections.
Although Homeland Security Department officials have said they are focusing their efforts on criminals, the fast pace of deportations in the last two years was felt in many Latino immigrant communities, and caused growing disillusionment with Mr. Obama.
