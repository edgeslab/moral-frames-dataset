Voters in California Back Pension Cuts for City Workers
LOS ANGELES -- As Wisconsin residents voted on Tuesday not to recall Gov.
Scott Walker -- who has become an enemy of labor unions nationwide -- two California cities dealt blows of their own to organized labor.
In San Diego and San Jose, voters overwhelmingly approved ballot initiatives designed to help balance ailing municipal budgets by cutting retirement benefits for city workers.
Around 70 percent of San Jose voters favored the pension measure, while 66 percent of San Diego residents supported a similar measure.
''This is really important to our taxpayers,'' Mayor Chuck Reed of San Jose, said Tuesday night.
''We'll get control over these skyrocketing retirement costs and be able to provide the services they are paying for.''
Statewide, voters also remained very closely divided on a $1-per-pack tax on cigarettes, which would be the first increase in the cigarette tax here in 14 years.
Proceeds from the tax would not go to state coffers, but would instead finance cancer research.
The tax remained too close to call on Wednesday morning, according to The Associated Press, although opponents of the measure appeared to cling to a razor-thin lead with all precincts reporting.
Antismoking advocates, who promoted the tax as the best way to reduce smoking rates, were outspent nearly four to one.
Their opponents, financed largely by the tobacco industry, spent almost $47 million in advertisements to defeat the measure.
