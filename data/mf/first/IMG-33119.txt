ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION; Enforcement challenge rejected
A federal appeals court in Atlanta has rejected legal efforts aimed at shutting down programs that give Cobb County and state police immigration enforcement powers.
In its ruling this month, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit against two of Georgia's 287(g) programs, named after the section of federal immigration law that authorizes them.
The appeals court said it found no legal error in the district court's opinion and agrees with its conclusions.
Two Mexican citizens and one Salvadoran citizen sued Cobb, state and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials last year, arguing their 287(g) programs are unconstitutional and should be scrapped.
Under the 287(g) program sheriff's deputies may be empowered to question people about whether they are in the country legally and to serve arrest warrants, prepare charging documents, and detain and transport criminals for immigration violations.
Those who sued alleged, among other things, that they were not notified of their Miranda rights when they were arrested and detained and that they were not granted access to attorneys while they were being questioned.
In October, a federal district court judge dismissed their complaint, saying they lacked standing because they could not "allege an imminent threat of future harm."
They appealed.
One of their attorneys said he disagreed with the appeals court's decision.
"It's truly disheartening that the complaint --- a catalog of shocking factual and constitutional abuses stemming from the 287(g) program --- might be summarily disposed of on a technical legal conclusion with which I respectfully disagree," said Erik Meder, an attorney for the plaintiffs.
