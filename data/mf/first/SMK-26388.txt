Healthy Outlook: Janyth Bolden When it comes to smoking, it's OK to be a quitter
For many years, I taught classes helping smokers to quit their habit.
One technique I used was to get them to write five reasons why they wanted to stop smoking.
I made the assignment a little more difficult by telling them they couldn't cite health concerns.
That might surprise you, but the truth is smokers know the health risks of what they're doing.
If they wanted to quit for health reasons, they would have done it long before they wound up sitting in a smoking cessation class.
To help them along in the exercise, I asked people in my classes to complete this sentence: "If I didn't smoke, I could ______."
I remember one person saying if he didn't smoke, he could have been with his mother when she passed away.
While she was very ill in the hospital, he had gone outside to take a smoke break; when he returned, she had died.
Another man said he could spend more time with his grandchild because his daughter refused to let him see the child while he was smoking.
Quitting smoking is extremely difficult.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 70 percent of smokers want to quit, and about 52 percent attempt to quit each year, although most don't successfully kick the habit.
But people do quit.
In fact, there are more former smokers than smokers now.
And for those who want to quit, there are plenty of cessation resources.
