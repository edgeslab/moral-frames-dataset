Los Angeles to Cease Transferring Immigrants
LOS ANGELES -- The police in this city will soon stop turning over illegal immigrants arrested for low-level crimes to federal immigration officials for deportation, Police Chief Charlie Beck announced on Thursday.
At a news conference, Chief Beck said he hoped to put in place a set of protocols by the start of next year, under which the Los Angeles police will no longer honor requests from federal agencies to detain illegal immigrants who are arrested for nonviolent offenses like driving without a license, illegal vending or being drunk in public unless they were part of a street gang or had a criminal record.
The announcement was the biggest and potentially most controversial step yet for Chief Beck, who has been in his post since 2009, into the highly politicized waters of immigration enforcement.
Under Secure Communities, a federal program that began in 2008, local law enforcement agencies share with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials the fingerprints of everyone they arrest.
But Chief Beck said the program had impeded efforts to keep the city safe by eroding trust between the Police Department and the communities in Los Angeles.
''Community trust is extremely important to effective policing,'' he said.
''So it's my intent, by issuing this change in procedures, that we gain this trust back.''
The new policy was welcomed by immigrant rights advocates, who were still stinging from Gov.
Jerry Brown's decision just a few days earlier to veto a bill, known as the Trust Act, that would have prohibited local law enforcement officials from detaining illegal immigrants for deportation if they have not been charged with serious or violent crimes.
