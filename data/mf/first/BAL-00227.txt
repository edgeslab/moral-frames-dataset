A Baltimore grand jury indicted all six police officers charged in the April death of Freddie Gray, the city's top prosecutor said Thursday.
The officers, who are free on bail, will be arraigned July 2, Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said at a news conference.
Gray, 25, died April 19 in the hospital, one week after he suffered a severe spinal injury during his arrest on a city street or immediately after as he was driven in a police van.
His death triggered several days of protests and some violence, which resulted in a citywide curfew.
Dozens of people were arrested, and several police officers were injured.
The charges were similar to those she announced three weeks ago, including the most serious -- second-degree depraved-heart murder.
Some lesser charges were dropped.
