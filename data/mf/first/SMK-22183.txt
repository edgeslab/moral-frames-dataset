Don't give up - St. Charles County can go smoke-free, too
The St. Charles County Council will not give us the right to vote for smoke-free workplaces for all of our citizens ("Smoking ban vote loses in St. Charles County," Nov. 29).
With the council's vote last week, we will go with the status quo and not protect all workers' health in St. Charles County.
I am really frustrated because we know how dangerous secondhand smoke is and we know that it kills approximately 1,200 Missourians each year.
Tobacco-related illnesses are a tremendous financial burden to all of us.
What can we do to make our "leaders" hear our cries?
We should:
- Not vote for politicians who don't support smoke-free workplaces for everyone.
- Not go to bars/restaurants/casinos that are not smoke-free.
- Not stand for rhetoric about "rights" and "freedom" for smokers.
They have no right to kill others from their secondhand smoke.
- Remember to not give up!
Many communities and more than half of states are smoke-free.
It will happen here, too, if we work together.
- Call or write politicians and local leaders so they know that the majority of St. Charles County residents support smoke-free.

I don't object to one-stop schedules, but I hate to be sent to Texas when I want to go east or west.
