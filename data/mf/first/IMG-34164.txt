Shut ICE detention facilities
Almost as profitable as it is despicable, the business of incarcerating powerless immigrants continues to thrive, three years after President Obama acknowledged the injustices that have made the U.S. immigration detention system a human rights scandal.
Despite Obama's promise in October 2009 to radically reform the system, little has changed: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) continues to subcontract the detention of individuals to county jails and private detention centers, and to hold in them more than 400,000 immigrants a year across the country.
According to the Detention Watch Network, detainees in those facilities "are subject to punitive treatment, inadequate medical care, vulnerable to rape and assault, and isolated from any access to legal assistance."
No one is spared from the system.
Families, undocumented and documented immigrants, people who have been in the U.S. for years, survivors of torture, asylum seekers and other vulnerable groups - including pregnant women, children and individuals who are seriously ill without proper medication or care - can be found in detention centers.
These human rights violations have been detailed in 10 reports compiled by the Detention Watch Network and released under the name of "Expose and Close."
The group also identified 10 of the worst prisons and jails where immigrants are held, and is asking the President to close them as a gesture of good will while the comprehensive immigration reform he promised becomes a reality.
