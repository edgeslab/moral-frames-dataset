An in-depth look at Obama's immigration reprieve
Who's eligible?
Anyone brought to the country illegally before they turned 16 and are 30 or younger; graduated from high school or are in school or in the military; lived here continuously for at least five years; and haven't committed "significant" crimes.
What's a "significant" crime?
Anyone convicted of a felony, three or more misdemeanors or any "significant" misdemeanor is likely to be barred from relief.
But what's a "significant" misdemeanor?
No one is certain but many lawyers suspect it will include drug possession, driving under the influence, assault and theft.
Also barred are people who present a "public safety threat," which is not limited to criminal convictions and could include any arrest, gang activity or juvenile offenses.
Decisions about who qualifies are under the government's discretion.
What do beneficiaries get?
A work permit that can be renewed every two years, and "deferred action," which means they won't be deported.
What they don't get: Legal permanent residency or a path to citizenship; access to most federal public benefits.
Could a new president reverse the initiative?
Yes, but he probably won't, most lawyers say.
It is a "real but very remote risk," said San Francisco immigration lawyer Mark Silverman.
"No one knows the answer to this question, but I think that an incoming Republican administration would conclude that it would be a serious long-term political mistake" to deport young people applying for or granted relief under a previous administration.
