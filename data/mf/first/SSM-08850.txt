After Success on Same-Sex Marriage, Gay Rights Group Uses Ad to Keep Pressure On
What do you do when, after more than 30 defeats in a row, you win four votes, all on the same Election Day?
The answer for an organization seeking equality for gay men and lesbians is to run a television commercial that celebrates the victories while at the same time looking beyond them.
The commercial, which first appeared Sunday morning, is being sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign, which raised millions of dollars in support on same-sex marriage votes this month in four states: Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington.
Voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington approved same-sex marriage and voters in Minnesota rejected a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to a man and a woman.
Also, voters in Wisconsin elected the country's first openly lesbian senator, Tammy Baldwin, and the nation re-elected a president who had endorsed same-sex marriage.
The commercial is narrated by the actor Morgan Freeman, who also narrated a commercial for (and donated money to) President Obama.
"America stands at the dawn of a new day," Mr. Freeman intones as vignettes appear on screen of the Statue of Liberty, the Constitution, suffrage marchers and the 1963 March on Washington.
"Freedom, justice and human dignity have always guided our journey toward a more perfect union."
As the scenes on screen change to vignettes of gay and lesbian couples and families, Mr. Freeman continues: "Now across our country, we are standing together for the right of gay and lesbian Americans to marry the person they love.
And with historic victories for marriage, we've delivered a mandate for full equality."
