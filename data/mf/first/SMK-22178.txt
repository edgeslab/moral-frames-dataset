Teens swapping cigarettes for flavored mini cigars
They come in ice cream flavors such as strawberry, watermelon, vanilla and chocolate.
They are packaged in colorful wrappers.
"Little cigars" are finding a niche among teens, who like the price - about a dollar - and the taste.
Young smokers say these cigarette-size little cigars and cigarillos - slimmer versions of big cigars - look better and can be bought one at a time instead of spending more than $5 for a pack of cigarettes.
Many teens also think that they are less addictive.
That's a problem.
"You have the same cancer-causing chemicals but wrapped in flavors that don't let you experience the harsh sensation of cigar or tobacco use," said Donald Shell, interim director for Maryland's Center for Health Promotion, Education, Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation.
Maryland is one of several states where the increase in youth cigar smoking has been large enough that it has caught up with and in some cases surpassed cigarette use in that age group, according to state and federal health data and anti-tobacco groups.
To fight back, the state will launch ads on billboards, buses and trains starting next week.
The home page of the campaign Web site, thecigartrap.com, shows youngsters running to an ice cream truck with a giant cigar on its roof.
"No matter how they sugarcoat it .
.
.
cigars kill," a warning reads.
