Raising the Cigarette Tax
To the Editor:
Gail Collins writes (column, June 6) that President Obama's plan to strengthen early childhood learning with a tobacco tax increase needs a ''groundswell'' of public demand.
I agree: all Americans should urge their members of Congress to pass this.
In addition to helping expand preschool, a higher tobacco tax would significantly reduce smoking, especially among children.
Even tobacco companies admit this in their internal documents.
The Congressional Budget Office and other respected economic institutions agree that tobacco tax increases both raise revenue and cut tobacco consumption.
The proposed 94-cent cigarette tax per pack would prevent more than a million children from smoking, saving hundreds of thousands of lives.
The Federal Trade Commission just reported that the tobacco industry increased marketing spending significantly in 2011.
The industry is ramping up marketing to children, mainly with price-discounting schemes.
Congress should counterstrike by raising the price of tobacco products aimed at children.
