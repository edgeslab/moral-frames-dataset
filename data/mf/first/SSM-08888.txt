A Big Leap for Marriage Equality
Progress on civil rights can occur in bursts.
The nation's march toward full equality for all took an important step forward on Election Day with groundbreaking victories for same-sex marriage across the country.
Until Tuesday, no state had ever legalized same-sex marriage through a ballot referendum.
This cause has been rejected more than 30 times at the ballot box, though six states and the District of Columbia have legalized gay marriage through court rulings or legislative measures.
In a move that shows the shift in public opinion, voters in Maine and Maryland approved measures giving gay and lesbian couples the freedom to marry by decisive results.
Early returns in Washington State also show that voters there have passed a same-sex marriage initiative.
With these victories, opponents will no longer be able to argue that the movement for marriage equality is something imposed by radical judges and legislators, who are out of touch with the popular will.
In Minnesota, meanwhile, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have enshrined the state's existing ban on same-sex marriage in the State Constitution.
In Wisconsin, voters elected a Democratic House member, Tammy Baldwin, to the United States Senate, making her the first openly gay person ever elected to the chamber.
In Iowa, voters decided to retain a State Supreme Court justice, David Wiggins, rejecting a campaign by the State Republican Party and other conservative forces to oust him because of his participation in the court's unani(mous ruling in 2009 allowing same-sex-marriage on equal protection grounds.
