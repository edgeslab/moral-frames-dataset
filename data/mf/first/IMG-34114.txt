California: 25 Arrested Off Coast In Suspected Smuggling Case
In a joint operation, federal law enforcement officials on Monday morning arrested 25 people suspected of human smuggling on a fishing boat off the coast of Southern California, the authorities announced.
The United States Coast Guard was notified by Border Patrol agents of a vessel approaching the shore near Rancho Palos Verdes in Los Angeles County around 5 a.m.
The type of vessel seized, known as a panga, has been increasingly used by smugglers to move drugs along the California coast; last week, a member of the Coast Guard was killed while trying to board a similar vessel.
