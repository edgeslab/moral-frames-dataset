Big Cigars Offer Way For Smokers To Save
Fewer Americans are smokingcigarettes, but a growing number are turning to cigarettelike cigars that can sell for as little as seven cents apiece or to making cigarettes from inexpensive loose tobacco labeled for pipe use, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday.
Sales of these other forms of tobacco -- which are taxed at significantly lower rates than both cigarettes and tobacco specifically labeled ''roll your own'' -- have soared in recent years, the C.D.C.
said.
The amount of loose pipe tobacco sold in 2011 was enough to make 17.5 billion cigarettes, a sixfold increase over the amount sold in 2008.
Meanwhile, sales of loose tobacco specifically labeled for roll-your-own use and taxed at higher rates dropped by 75 percent during the same four-year period.
''While consumption patterns of traditional cigarettes have continued to decline, when we take into account these alternative cigarettelike products, we're seeing a lack of change in the overall consumption of burned tobacco that is being inhaled,'' said Terry Pechacek, associate director for science with the C.D.C.
Office on Smoking and Health in Atlanta and one of the report's authors.
Overall consumption dropped by less than 1 percent in 2011 from 2010, he said.
Meanwhile, sales of large cigars more than doubled from 2008 to 2011, after manufacturers increased the weight of certain small cigars, enabling them to be classified as large cigars, which are taxed at a lower rate than small cigars and cigarettes, a C.D.C.
commentary noted.
