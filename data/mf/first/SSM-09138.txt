Is America becoming more socially liberal?
Social issues worked in President Obama's favor on Election Day -- the same day that multiple states voted for the first time to legalize both gay marriage and recreational marijuana.
And that confluence has some suggesting the country is shifting to the left on social issues.
But it's really too early to say that.
While the country has shifted significantly more liberal on gay marriage and marijuana in the last two decades, most other issues haven't followed suit.
In fact, Americans actually appear to be getting more conservative when it comes to two major social issues: abortion and guns.
Below is a compilation of polling from 1995 until today on support for the liberal position on four social issues: gay marriage, marijuana legalization, abortion rights and gun control.
The upward trends on marijuana and gay marriage are strikingly similar, with support steadily rising from less than 30 percent in the mid-1990s all the way to today, when about half the country supports both.
But if you look at abortion, Gallup polling actually shows support dropping below 50 percent since the mid-90s.
The trend hasn't been as pronounced as the upward trend for gay marriage and marijuana legalization, but it is statistically significant.
Meanwhile, the country has moved significantly to the right on guns, with less than half now calling for more strict gun laws.
(One issue that's not on this chart but is notable: Immigration.
Despite increased talk about immigration reform after the 2012 election, polls suggest the country hasn't really shifted much when it comes to support for a path to citizenship.)
