Q: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently published the number of people murdered by guns each year in the U.S.
I would like to know the number of deaths in the U.S. every year that can be directly related to cigarette smoking and car wrecks.
--- Jim Turner, Rutledge
A: Smoking, the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., causes about 380,000 deaths a year, according to research by the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products.
Using new types of research, the Center for Tobacco Products found there are about 200,000 smoking-attributable deaths among men and 180,000 smoking-attributable deaths among women every year.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website states: "More deaths are caused each year by tobacco use than by all deaths from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries, suicides and murders combined."
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reported that 32,367 people died in motor vehicle accidents in 2011, the lowest number of fatalities since 1949.
