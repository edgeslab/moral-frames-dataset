Dems trying to aid immigs
ALBANY - Assembly Democrats are looking to offer state tuition assistance to undocumented immigrants who qualify for President Obama's new "deferred action" status.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan) and two other Democratic lawmakers announced legislation Friday to extend the popular Tuition Assistance Program and other aid initiatives to cover immigrants who obtain the temporary immigration status afforded largely to young people who came illegally to the United States as children.
Currently, undocumented students are not eligible for state tuition assistance programs, though they are charged the same tuition as other students at SUNY and CUNY schools.
"These young immigrants, who really know no other home than the United States, deserve the same opportunities and chance to succeed," Silver said.
The legislation, faces an uphill battle in the GOP-controled Senate.
