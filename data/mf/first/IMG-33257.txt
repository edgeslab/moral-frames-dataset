How to avoid being asked to 'show your papers'
Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has green-lighted the part of the Arizona immigration law that requires local law enforcement officers to ask people suspected of being illegal immigrants to "show their papers," it's only a matter of time before Florida's troglodyte-infested legislature follows suit.
This means you might want to start thinking about how you can look and act more like a bona fide American citizen here in Florida.
Especially if this preparation can spare you the embarrassment of being stopped by a local police officer who then suspects by your appearance or demeanor that you also might be in this country illegally.
"There is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced," Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the U.S. Supreme Court opinion.
"At this stage, without the benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume (the law) will be construed in a way that creates a conflict with federal law."
In other words, Kennedy and rest of the court's majority are willing to imagine that law enforcement officers are capable of identifying possible illegal immigrants among the general public without relying on any unconstitutional racial or ethnic profiling.
If that's true, then a blond woman in a BMW has an equal chance of being asked to prove her citizenship as a Guatemalan dishwasher on a bicycle.
