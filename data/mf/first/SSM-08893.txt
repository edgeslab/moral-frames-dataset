Gay-marriage backers end losing streak, look ahead ELECTIONS 2012
NEW YORK o For years, foes of same-sex marriage had a potent talking point: They'd won every time the issue went to a popular vote.
That winning streak has now been shattered in a multistate electoral sweep by gay marriage supporters - a historic tipping point likely to influence other states and perhaps even the Supreme Court.
"It's an astounding day," said Kevin Cathcart of the gay-rights group Lambda Legal, recalling that in 2004 alone the gay-marriage movement went 0-13 in statewide elections and was 0-32 overall since 1998.
In Tuesday's voting, however, Maine and Maryland became the first states ever to approve same-sex marriage by popular vote.
Washington state seemed poised to follow suit, although slow ballot-counting there continued Wednesday.
And in Minnesota, voters rejected a proposal to place a ban on gay-marriage in the state constitution, a step taken in past elections in 30 other states.
"The anti-gay opposition kept moving the goal posts and had as their last talking point that we could not win a popular vote," said Evan Wolfson, president of the advocacy group Freedom to Marry.
"Last night, voters in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and, all signs suggest, Washington proved them wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong."
Heading into the election, gay marriage was legal in six states and the District of Columbia, in each case because of legislation or court orders rather than votes.
