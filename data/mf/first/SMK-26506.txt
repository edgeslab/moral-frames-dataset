Huffs and puffs!
Judge tells transsexual smoker heiress to clean up act
A RECLUSIVE transsexual heiress once convicted of beating her millionaire mom is in trouble for stinking up the famed El Dorado on Central Park West with her secondhand cigarette smoke.
A Manhattan judge said Thursday that Diane Wells, 59, must begin using air purifiers and allow ventilation repairs in apartment 9B after neighbors complained her persistent puffing was giving them headaches, irritated eyes and respiratory infections.
"(It's) so awful that on numerous nights it has interrupted (our) ability to sleep," upstairs neighbor Natalie Elsberg said in an affidavit.
Building managers said Wells, who was raised Jonathan Cheney, has ignored their pleas to address the problem and owes $42,544 in building fees.
Wells was arrested in June 2005 on a charge she broke her mother's arm in a fight over her inheritance.
She served a 60-day jail sentence, but the conviction was overturned on legal grounds.
She's now fighting a younger brother who claims their late mother's estate should include the $4 million co-op.
