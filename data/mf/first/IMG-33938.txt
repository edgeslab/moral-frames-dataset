Self-Deportation
The Republican platform drafting committee has adopted the "self-deportation" immigration "solution" that Mitt Romney embraced during the primaries.
This is the idea that it is not only possible to force 11 million undocumented immigrants to leave the country by making them miserable, but also desirable--presumably because Americans are itching to get back to farm labor, domestic and restaurant work, small-scale entrepreneurship and other backbreaking, minimal-wage jobs that illegal immigrants have stolen from them.
"If you really want to create a job tomorrow, you can remove an illegal alien today," said the delegate Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state who wrote Arizona's "self-deportation" immigration law and carbon copies in other states, and successfully offered several amendments to the platform.
This view does not allow for the complexity of the immigration mess, it does not accept the value of assimilating workers whom the economy and country need, or the possibility of turning anyone, ever, into future Americans.
It simply says: Get out.
And take your American kids with you.
The platform calls for the federal government to force businesses in every state to use the E-Verify electronic database to check the immigration status of new hires.
It calls for a double-walled fence along the Mexican border, and an end to federal lawsuits challenging state immigration laws.
(Despite rampant concerns about racial profiling and other civil-rights abuses in states such as Arizona and Alabama, the Department of Justice would be told to stay out; nothing to see there.)
