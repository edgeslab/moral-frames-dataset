Gay couples begin saying 'I do'
SEATTLE - Same-sex couples in Washington state began reciting wedding vows across the state on Sunday, the first day they could marry after the state's gay marriage law took effect.
About 140 couples had registered to marry at Seattle City Hall, which had set up five chapels to accommodate the revelers.
Starting at 10 a.m., cheers and applause regularly broke out as another couple's marriage became official.
Weddings at city hall were to continue through 5 p.m.
Mayor Mike McGinn, who greeted couples as they arrived, called it a "great day, a joyous day."
"It's really wonderful," he said.
"A new civil right is going to be recognized in this great civil institution."
Keith Bacon and Corianton Hale of Seattle, who celebrated their six-year anniversary the night before, hugged and kissed to loud cheers and camera flashes as they took their vows before one of the 16 local judges who volunteered to officiate the weddings on Sunday.
"We're totally thrilled," Bacon said.
The couple had done a commitment ceremony in August but said this day was special.
"We had looked at this as maybe a day we would sign a piece of paper and seal the deal, and instead we're having this huge party being thrown in our honor," Bacon said.
"It's just mind-blowing."
Nancy Monahan, 57, a retired petty officer with the Coast Guard, waited outside before the weddings began with her partner of 14 years, Deb Needham, 48.
