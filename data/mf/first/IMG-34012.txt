Second victim of fatal I-680 crash Identified
Authorities have identified the second of two people killed early Sunday in a chain-reaction crash on Interstate 680.
Brandon Rosevear, 18, of Concord, was identified as the driver of a Nissan Maxima that clipped the backside of a BMW while driving south on I-680 just south of Crow Canyon Road at 1:22 a.m., according to the Contra Costa County Coroner's Office.
The passenger of the silver BMW was identified yesterday as Mehrdad Emami, 46, of San Ramon.
The driver of the BMW, an unidentified 40-year-old woman from San Ramon, remains hospitalized with major injuries, the CHP said.
How or why the young driver hit the rear bumper of the BMW was still under investigation, the CHP said, but the collision caused both cars to spin into a construction area, the CHP said.
The Nissan Maxima struck a forklift on the driver's side and became engulfed in flames with Rosevear inside.
