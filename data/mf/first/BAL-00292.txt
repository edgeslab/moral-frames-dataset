The number of Baltimore businesses known to have been damaged by riots and looting last week has reached about 300, state officials said Thursday.
The Department of Housing and Community Development is offering no-interest loans of up to $35,000 for terms of one to five years under the Baltimore Business Recovery Loan Program to help businesses recover, agency officials said.
Businesses with greater losses might qualify for another loan program meant to stimulate investment in older communities.
Those loans can run as high as $500,000, with interest below market rates and repayment terms of up to 15 years, the agency said.
The violence came amid protests over the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died April 19 from a spinal injury he received while in police custody.
